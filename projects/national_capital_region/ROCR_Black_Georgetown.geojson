In the 1950s the Board of Health closed the dilapidated cemetery. Through protest and support of organizations planning the U.S. Bicentennial celebration, Mt. Zion Cemetery was declared an Historic Landmark. The cemetery is located behind the row of townhouses on the north side of the 2700 block of Q Street, NW.",
