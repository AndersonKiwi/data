        "details": "The dam at Lake 4 was built into an exposure of rocks of the Wissahickon Formation of Precambrian Age - about 600 million years ago. The earth’s climates and features during this time were vastly different from the present. North America and Africa were joined together in a supercontinent. Near the end of the era this supercontinent split, or rifted, and formed the continents of Africa and North America. Later, the same force that caused the continents to separate then caused them to move toward each other. A large volcano rose higher and higher off the east coast of North America. Deep in the earth, a group of rocks known as the Wissahickon (Wis-suh-hik-un) formation formed as the ocean floor was driven beneath the eastern edge of the North American continent.  If you were standing on top of these rocks, you can see the glittery “sparkles” of the mineral called mica, which is indicative of metamorphic rocks. You could also see large cracks or fractures throughout this rock exposure. With seasonal temperature changes; the fractures deepen and widen the cracks causing large blocks of rock to dislodge."

        "details": "It is now 25-57 million years past the making of the Wissahickon rocks. The volcano has merged with North America, is a lot smaller, and its slopes are littered with ocean sediments. The vast continent of Africa crashes into the eastern coast of North America. The ground buckles, cracks, and folds while the Appalachian mountain range grows higher and higher to the west. Later, the volcano lies on its side like a toppled deck of cards. The volcanic rocks and ocean sediments along most of the east coast are then melted and recrystallized into a huge rock mass containing many different colored minerals and layers. Streams from the west then begin to deposit sediments that will eventually bury the area under a thick blanket of rock debris.  The rocks laying in Quantico Creek are the metamorphosed remnants of the ocean sediments and volcanic flows. These rocks are part of the Chopawamsic (Chop-uh-wam-zik) formation. Chopawamsic rocks cover almost of the entire northern and western sections of the park. The pinkish lines running through the rock are quartz and formed as an addition to the rock at a much later date.",

        "details": "Our next stop in time is the Jurassic period approximately 200 million years ago, when enormous dinosaurs roamed the land. To the east, a large fissure in the ground opens up that extends the length of the continent. Africa and North America separate for the second time. Meanwhile, streams and their origins in the Blue Ridge Mountains slowly erase all signs of the rift by continually eroding away the mountains and depositing sediments in the east. Sea level rises and the entire east coast is submerged beneath the ocean. Everything is buried beneath a thick layer of ocean sediments. Later, streams scour out the buried mountains and its valley to the east.  Hidden beneath the layers of soil and leaves at this site is the boundary between the Piedmont and Coastal Plain. The cascading sections of the north branch of Quantico Creek reveal the presence of this boundary. The Fall Line is the name given to this boundary and extends from New Jersey to Georgia. The stream flows downstream through natural cracks or joint systems in the rock. During floods, the seemingly immovable rocks in this stream are rolled along the bed or bottom. This part of Quantico Creek is transporting large amounts of sediment as well as eroding the exposed rocks.",

All streams transport their load of sediment in three ways: in solution (dissolved load), in suspension (suspended load), and along the bottom of the channel (bed load). The nearby sediments of Quantico Creek consist of alluvium (mud, sand, and gravel) that has accumulated here during recent geologic time. If the loose sediments in this stream were to become cemented together, the result would be a sedimentary rock (Fig. 3). Notice the flaky, shiny specks of mica found in the sand along the trail. Only the harder, or more resistant rocks remain in the area after the wearing and tearing journey downstream.",

The creek at this site is no longer downcutting into the ground like it was further upstream. Evidence for this is the lack of steep V-shaped channels or banks. As the stream approaches sea level, it begins to bend back and forth in a series of meanders. Notice what happens to the nearby trees on the bank of the creek which are in the path of the shifting meander. Flood plain sediments are extremely rich in nutrients and minerals and make excellent farmland.",

        "details": "The fine sedimentary particles in this stream may someday be buried, along with the accumulation of dead organic material from the forest, and be converted into a sedimentary rock. If there is enough heat and pressure at its depth underneath the ground, the organic material will undergo a chemical reaction and change into oil. This normally occurs at depths of 1,000 feet to 20,000 feet or more. If the temperature exceeds 100-150 degrees Celsius, then the oil will transform into natural gas. When searching for oil, geologists often look for the sandy deposits of an ancient river that ran through a forested area, such as the Quantico Creek.",

        "details": "The large hillside, west of the raised walkway, is the main area of the mine operation. The area is underlain by the metamorphic rocks of the Chopawamsic Formation.  During the mine’s operation and after its closure, sulfuric acid leaked into the soil and nearby stream from waste rock piles causing the soil and water to become too acidic to support life. Without any plants to hold the soil in place, erosion of the hill occurred rapidly and the stream became devoid of life. In 1994 the park cleaned up the mine to correct these harmful effects.  This is the last stop on the main trail. As you walk back along the Pyrite Mine Road toward the Scenic Drive, take note of the rocks located along the hilltop and on the road. They are Coastal Plain sediments and formed as streams flowed into an ancient tidal area of the Atlantic Ocean.",
