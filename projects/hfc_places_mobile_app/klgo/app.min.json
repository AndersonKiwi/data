Even before these attacks, the U.S. Army recognized Alaska's strategic location and began using the White Pass and Yukon Route (WP&YR) railroad to supply defense projects in the interior, such as the Alcan (Alaska) Highway, Canol Pipeline, and airfields along the Northwest Staging Route. The WP&YR previously operated two trains daily to Whitehorse, but it now needed to run 17 to 20 trains each day. The 770th Railway Operating Battalion took command of the railroad line spanning 110 miles of tough terrain. Conditions were often extreme, leading Private Howard Foley to state, \"That line's too steep for a goat and too cold for a polar bear.\" As many as 5,000 people were stationed in Skagway where Quonset huts sprouted like weeds in vacant lots and the Army took over many existing buildings. Cement, pipe, bulldozers, and approximately 22,000 troops and construction workers passed through the town. After the war ended in 1946, the WP&YR and Skagway residents resumed peacetime operations, proud of the transportation role they played during World War II.

Main body text: Since prehistoric times, the coastal Tlingit Natives traded extensively with the inland Tagish First Nations using the Chilkoot corridor beginning at nearby Dyea. The White Pass corridor that began in Skagway was also used, but not as extensively. These routes allowed trade and cultural exchange to develop between peoples on both sides of the mountains. The Tlingit were not the only people to see the advantages of these corridors. Euroamerican prospectors began using the Chilkoot Trail in the 1880s to search for gold in the interior. In 1887, Skookum Jim (Keish), a Tagish man, guided Captain William Moore over the White Pass. That autumn, the Captain, his son Ben, and a Tlingit helper, Nan Suk, began building a wharf and cabin in what became Skagway. Captain Moore saw Skagway\'s potential with its deep water harbor and access to the interior. He believed many gold discoveries would occur in the north, and he intended to capitalize on the migration of people. With this in mind, Ben Moore filed a 160-acre land claim and both father and son began developing what was to become Skagway--the Gateway to the Interior. Historic photograph of Tlingit woman hiking.

Main body text: When news of an extraordinary gold discovery in Canada's Yukon Territory reached the public in 1897, people across the globe raced to the Klondike hoping to become rich beyond their wildest dreams. Thousands boarded ships, steamed up Alaska's Inside Passage, and disembarked at Skagway or Dyea. Skagway's  waterfront was a chaotic scene of pitched tents, shouting stampeders, neighing horses, and barking dogs. Streets were quickly laid out, buildings and wharves constructed, and the town even boasted of having electricity, telephone service, and running water. To reach the Klondike, stampeders had to choose between two routes. One was the 33-mile Chilkoot Trail out of Dyea, containing a torturous thousand-foot-climb known as the Golden Staircase. The alternative was the 45-mile White Pass Trail, starting in Skagway. It was infamously named the Dead Horse Trail because pack animals were pushed to the limit. Both trails met near Bennet, British Columbia, where many of the stampeders built or bought boats and waited for the ice to break up. They then floated 550 miles though the lake systems and the Yukon River to reach Dawson City, Canada. Historic photograph of hikers on the Golden Staircase superimposed on background image.

Although his toll gates were sometimes ignored, the enterprise was relatively successful until the White Pass & Yukon Route (WP&YR) railroad began laying track in late May 1898.

Haa Shagóon is how we refer to our ancestors, which can be translated to “our tools of life.” The most important lesson they have left us with is to respect all things, living and dead, large and small. To do this, to whole-heartedly do this, requires a person to place all things before themselves; which is the true spirit of a warrior. Many times throughout history, the Native people of North America have been portrayed as fierce warriors. The image of our warriors is not often as protectors, but as killers. Our warriors, x’eigaa káa, are brave and humble enough to know that they must have respect for all things. To know this is to know our people. In our language, in our culture, the relationship between things is most important. The way a person interacts and fits within their world is their most important journey. To truly be Tlingit, one must understand this,  especially towards things that are helpless or delicate. This is what we strive for within our cultural life. Quote: "Aaa.

With thousands of stampeders using the White Pass and Chilkoot Trails, both countries laid claim to the boom towns of Skagway and Dyea. In February 1898, a surprise move by the Canadian government ensured that both the White and Chilkoot passes would be controlled by Canada. The North - West Mounted Police were quietly sent to both summits, where they established posts and began collecting customs duties. Each post was equipped with a Maxim machine gun, ammunition, and supplies for six months.  This bold move established a de facto boundary across the disputed territory and helped control the flow of people to Canada. The final boundary line was set in 1903 after much debate by the Alaska Boundary Tribunal.

The word Deiyaa means "to pack." Shaa Shakee (the Chilkoot Trail) started here and crossed one of the few ice-free passes available for hundreds of miles. The Taiya Inlet was used as a transportation corridor between major villages like Tlakw Aan (Klukwan) and smaller outlying villages like Deiyaa. Travel by yaakw (canoe) was necessary as no overland trains between these locations existed. Many of the place names we use today, like Yaakw Deiyaa.aa (Yakutania Point) which means "place to pack your canoe," are derived from the Tlingit language. Families frequently traveled the inlet and rivers to collect food and medicinal plants. Each spring, small fish called eulachon were rendered into oil that was used for cooking and medicine. Cranberries, seaweed, mussels, mountain goats and fish were also harvested. Many of these products were not available to the people of the interior and were packed over the trail to trade for meat and hides of moose and caribou. Traders\' packs were also laden with plant products from the interior and perhaps gifts from relatives. Fishing for eulachon, collecting of plant materials, and trade with the interior continue to be part of family traditions among Native people of the area.',caption:"Background image: Historic photograph of man in canoe with mountains in background.

Steamships departing from Seattle and San Francisco sailed the Inside Passage, much as cruise ships do today. At Skagway a deep water port was available, but here at Dyea the bay was shallow and mud flats guarded the shore. Steamships stopped far offshore, and goods and passengers were loaded onto smaller boats called "lighters." Once the lighters reached shallow water, they were hastily unloaded to beat the rising tide. The town of Dyea boomed rapidly from a Tlingit village to a busy gold rush supply town. From here, stampeders carried loads of supplies up the famous Chilkoot Trail and over the pass to the headwayers of the Yukon River. Imagine the noise and chaos of hundreds of stampeders unloading their supplies on the tidal mud flats. Consider the impacts this influx of outsiders had on the Native people living here.',caption:"Bottom left photo, historic photograph of ship on the water.

Tlingit packers began their trading expeditions here and a village was established with a trading post run by John J. Healy and Edgar Wilson in 1884. The tiny hamlet quickly grew into a town of approximately 8,000 people as fortune seekers who chose Dyea as their entry point to reach the Yukon Territory gold fields off-loaded tons of supplies in the boomtown of Dyea. The town's shallow harbor and inadequate port facilities, a devastating avalanche which occurred up the Chilkoot Trail on April 3, 1898, and the ending of the Klondike Gold Rush itself were reasons for its eventual decline. The final blow to Dyea came that same year with the construction of the 110-mile White Pass & Yukon Route Railway, linking Skagway to Whitehorse, Canada.

Text: The history of Shgagwei (Skagway), Deiyaa (Dyea), and A Shakee (Chilkoot Trail/Chilkoot Pass) is complex. Like many places throughout the United States, what was viewed as discovery and opportunity for wealth from the perspective of American culture was the invasion of the traditional territory of an indigenous population. Many organizations celebrate the gold rush of Alaska without recognizing that it marked a time of tremendous suffering, loss, and oncoming oppression for Skagway's first people. The Tribe in Skagway is attempting to bridge the gaps that exist in and around our community from a Tribal perspective. Over the last hundred years, the physical and cultural landscape of this area has changed dramatically. This place was once a vital bridge between Coastal and Interior indigenous groups, who relied upon routes into the interior to trade the riches of the sea for those of the land. Inland groups savored preserved salmon, fish, and seal oils, and sea vegetation; and bartered with invaluable copper, moose and caribou meat and hides. The coming of the gold rush and breakup of traditional Native territory divided families, clans, and traditions. Traditional land ownership included Tlingit control of the Chilkoot Trail and the recognized right to charge outsiders (such as other Natives and \"stampeders\") fees for access to it. Attempts to protect these ancestral rights have been portrayed as a jealous effort to retain monopoly of the Chilkoot Trail. This perspective ignores the historical oppression of this area's Native people and demeans them for having tried to protect everything they once had. Skagway Traditional Council and Carcross/Tagish First Nations (CTFN) have begun to address and resolve cross-border issues including traditional trading practices, historical migration patterns, and the use of the Chilkoot Trail. The Native peoples' losses have not been properly acknowledged in light of what brought wealth to the newcomers of this rugged land. Through this project, the creation of signs from the perspective of the Tribe as a joint Federal-Tribal effort, the hope exists that this trail, which has become a difficult symbol for a people divided, may once again become a symbol of unity, growth, and sharing for all the people who live within its shadow. Quote: \"We look forward to a time when we will have, as promise, an equal partnership as stewards of this place that is so important to both of our histories, and so important to our history together... Our people have much to offer the Yukon Territory, Canada, and the United States. It will be good to honor together how our heritages meet 100 years ago. It will be good to repair what has been damaged and move forward together.  It will be good to see this trail and this land cared for the in ways of our tradition... It will be good to see people moving in our land who respect and understand the difficult heritage we share. It will be good to see those people moving in our land with peacefulness, and with hope that we can make such a difficult symbol, the Chilkoot Trail, good for all of us again.\" Quote by CTFN Chief Andy Carvill, Gold Rush Centennial, 1998.

The Death and Rebirth of a Village. Text: This place is the village of Deiyáa, which can be translated to “Pack Trail”\nand it is a key area of Northern Tlingit country. It is one of many areas that link the coast to the interior, and has been a valuable trade route for the Tlingit people for much longer than written history in this area. According to traditional history, the Tlingit migrated to the coast from the interior in several areas: Shtaxhéen (Stikine River - “Silty River”), T’aawákw Galakú (T’aakú - Taku - “Flooding Geese”), Naadaashaahéeni (Carcross\n- “Water Flowing off the Mountain”), Lkóot (Chilkoot - “The Lake that Puked”), and Jilkáat (Chilkat - “Food Cache”). While Shgagwéi (Skagway - “Roughed up or bunched up water” or\n“Whitecaps”) served mostly as an area for seasonal hunting and fishing camps, Deiyáa was a village that local elders have described as smaller than Deishú (Haines - “End of the Trail”) and Tlákw Aan (Klukwan - “Eternal Village”). It was a place for families who did not want to live in a village with several hundred residents. This area was occupied by families from Deishú, Tlákw Aan, and Naadaashaahéeni. The primary clans in the area are Lukaax.ádi (Raven-Sockeye), Kaagwaantaan (Eagle-Wolf ), Deisheetaan (Raven-Beaver), Dakl’aweidí (Eagle-Killer Whale) and Yanyeidí (Wolf ). There was a time when dugout canoes made of cedar or cottonwood lined the beaches of Deiyáa. Valuable foods from the sea like salmon, eulachon, seaweeds, seal, and clams, as well as seal and eulachon grease, were packed into the interior. These foods are collectively referred to as Haa Shagóon Atxáyi (“Our Ancestor’s Food”) and are central to the culture of the Tlingit people. They were traded with interior Tlingit and other Tribes for moose, beaver, copper, mountain goat, and mountain sheep. Today, they remain an important part of the traditional lifestyle, ceremony, and diet of the Tlingit people.The village of Deiyáa vanished beneath the stampede of the gold rush. With an influx of over 10,000 foreigners, the landscape was forever changed. A rapid decline in traditional\nTlingit presence, rights, and activities in the area began, and has\ncontinued ever since. Tribal activity has resurged in the area as the Skagway Traditional Council is working to revitalize their cultural ties to the land and to their ancestral partnership with the Carcross/Tagish First Nations of Canada. Skagway is in many ways symbolic of the fate of the Tlingit people. Where traditions and cultural activity were once dormant or dissipating, they are resurging and becoming more visible and shared. In turn, the community is recognizing the value of understanding this knowledge, whose origin pre-dates any written history. Quote: "Tsu heidei shugaaxtootaan yaa yakoosge daakeit a jeex’ anak has kawdikeet." Quote by: Kichnáalx, Sheet’ká. Quote: We will once again open this container of wisdom left in our care." Quote by: George Davis, Sitka. The ways of the Tlingit culture are based on cultural knowledge, respect, and a tradition of loving\nand helping one another. Today, there are children and adults working to learn the Tlingit language, which has been ranked as one of the most difficult languages in the world. Through these efforts, more of the culture will be understood, given life again,\nand taught to future generations. The most important fact to retain is that the Tlingit people of Skagway are here today and forever, reviving their culture, telling their own story, and honoring ancestors who created the Tlingit history of this traditional land.

Originally constructed in 1898, a corner entry led to the “Mascotte” saloon, owned by Charles Rohbak, who sold liquor, cigars, and fresh beer on draft for ten cents. In early 1899, however, a new law came into force as Skagway transitioned from frontier town to family town, requiring Skagway’s saloons to pay a $1,500 license fee in order to remain open. Of the 80 saloons reported open in January 1899, all but a dozen had closed by April, including Rohbak’s “Mascotte.” After its closure, entrepreneur Albert Reinert and a partner purchased the building, paid the license fee, and began remodeling the interior. As a former restaurant owner, Reinert knew how to keep customers with offers of free lunches including clam chowder, spareribs, enchiladas, and more, along with locally brewed pilsner beer for a nickel a schooner. But moral reforms were sweeping Skagway at the start of the 20th century, and by 1916 Skagway had voted itself a “dry” town. Impressively, the renamed “Mascot” was one of only three Gold Rush-era saloons that survived until local prohibition. Eventually Reinert sold the Mascot to Perry Hern, who converted the interior to a pharmacy, and owned the complex for the next thirty years. In 1974 the National Park Foundation acquired the structure from George Rapuzzi and Charles Hermans, and in 1976, building ownership transferred to the National Park Service.

From second-floor bay windows the dispatcher could see approaching and departing trains on the tracks that once curved around the cutaway southwest corner and headed north on Broadway toward the gold fields of the Klondike. Listen for the train’s whistle blow - during the Second World War, twelve trains left Skagway for the Interior every day!  During this era, the depot and adjacent administration building were leased and operated by the U.S. Army, and played a critical role in the construction of the Alaska-Canada) Highway.

Smiths Parlor” was the saloon and headquarters of Jefferson Randolph Smith, better known as “Soapy Smith.” Smith was Skagway’s most infamous con-man, who arrived in Skagway sometime in 1897 and began operating from this building on 6th Avenue, May 1898. The interior during Soapy’s reign has been described as a restaurant with a large mahogany bar. The back room “parlor” was where victims were sometimes robbed while gang members ran away with the loot. Soapy met his demise soon after J. D. Stewart, a gold miner returning from the Klondike, was robbed by his gang. Soapy was killed in a shoot-out by Frank Reid on July 8, 1898 and both are buried in Skagway’s Gold Rush Cemetery. In the years following Soapy’s death, this false-front wood-frame building changed hands several times.  As new owner Martin Itjen took over in 1935, restoration efforts and improvements soon followed, based on historical photographs.  Itjen reconstructed the building to a version of what Soapy’s Parlor had been, and papered the interior walls with newspapers dating from the gold rush to the 1930s. When he reopened the building as a museum, Itjen used his wizardry at mechanics and installed a manikin of Soapy Smith that turned from the bar and greeted visitors to the museum.  The Jeff. Smith Parlor Museum became a highlight on his Skagway tours. Upon Itjen’s death in 1924, George Rapuzzi, a collector of gold rush memorabilia, and Itjen’s long-time friend, took over the museum and moved the building to the current location in 1964. With his wife Edna, George repaired and renovated the building which was open to the public from 1967 to 1986.  In December 2008, the Rasmuson Foundation donated the ‘George and Edna Rapuzzi Collection,’ which included five historic buildings and a large collection of artifacts from 1898 through the late 1960’s to the National Park Service.

With thousands of anxious prospectors wildly making their way through Skagway on their way to the Klondike Gold Fields, some could find rest on the many bunks and cots within, and feast on meals served en masse. As the Gold Rush era waned, the hotel was remodeled in 1898 to serve as a hardware store.

This shop fits the stereotypical appearance of a western boomtown false front building, common in Gold Rush era architecture in Skagway. To grab the attention of thousands of potential customers, elaborate false fronts such as this projected an image of size, prosperity, and stability. A look at the roofline from the side will reveal its false front, which masked the simple, gabled-roof building behind. The use of this structure is also common to false-front structures in Skagway; a small shop on the first floor and the shopkeeper’s residence upstairs.

Constructed in 1887-1888 by Captain Moore, his son, Ben, and Nan-Suk, a Tlingit native, it is the oldest structure in town. Original newspapers from the late nineteenth century, once used as interior decoration, still adhere to the walls and ceiling of the cabin. Captain Moore was a veteran of gold rushes. He predicted that there would one day be a great gold rush in the Yukon and Alaska and that stampeders would make their way up the Skagway River Valley to get there. He and his son claimed a homestead, built a cabin, and constructed a wharf. When the rush finally came, his land was overrun by a flood of stampeders. Nevertheless, Captain William Moore and his family prospered, and he lived to see his homestead turn into a significant port and railroad town. The life of Ben Moore exemplifies the pioneer spirit of Alaska. As a young man he plied the Inside Passage and traveled up and down the Yukon River, looking for gold and working at various jobs in fishing, mining, and packing. Ben Moore married Klinget-Sai-Yet, daughter of a Tlingit leader, and named her Minnie. In 1897 he began constructing a frame house just south of his father's cabin. This small beginning became the nucleus of the present Ben Moore House. Over the years, continued additions and remodeling created a sizeable home. By 1907 Ben Moore and his family moved to Tacoma, Washington. The house was rented by jeweler Herman Kirmse and later purchased by his wife Hazel in 1914.

Partners Lynch & Kennedy were the first owners of the new store and sold men’s attire and dry goods, and theirs is one of the town’s finest examples of false front architecture and reflects the hoped-for stability in Skagway. The local paper, The Daily Alaskan, reported that “The store is just about the handsomest in the city… It is a fine addition to business life of the city.” It remains a fine example of Gold Rush era architecture, and today continues its role in Skagway’s commercial present as part of the National Park Service’s Lease Back Program.",geofence_buffer_in_meters:10,id:null,information:[],latitude:59.45450402,longitude:-135.3166991,map_thumbnail_image:null,media:null,name:"Lynch & Kennedy",name_description:"The story of the Lynch and Kennedy exemplifies the entrepreneurial spirit and architecture of early Skagway.",primary_audio:null,primary_image:39,type:"Business (NPS)",services:[]},{description:"The Red Front Building was originally a paint and wallpaper company built during the gold rush.

Known as the Frye-Bruhn refrigerated warehouse, it was owned by brothers Frank and Charles Frye and Charles Bruhn and was part of the Frye-Bruhn Meat Packing Company, of Seattle, Washington.  Incorporated in 1891, the company rapidly expanded during the gold rush and soon had stores in several locations in Alaska including Haines, Juneau, Seward, Skagway, Valdez, and a cattle ranch in Katmai.  This building, part of the Frye-Bruhn meat packing empire, was first used briefly as a slaughter house.  It was remodeled in May 1900 and turned into a refrigerated warehouse for meat.  The Frye-Bruhn Company sold the warehouse in September 1919 to Anthony Dortero, a Skagway fruit dealer and clothier to men, for $450, but continued to operate in Skagway until the mid-1930s.  Mr. Dortero died in 1920 but his widow, Sabina, kept the property until 1945.  After that it was owned by several people before being donated to the National Park Service. Exactly when the refrigeration equipment in the old building quit working is unknown but it still contains parts of the original refrigeration coils and overhead track used to keep the meat cool and to move it around.  What is the future of the warehouse? The National Park Service recently moved it across 5th Avenue to where you see it now. The next step is to decide whether it should stay here or be moved to another location and stabilize it. Research and preservation work will need to be done to save the warehouse and put it back into use either as a storage building, interpretive facility, or commercial lease.",geofence_buffer_in_meters:10,id:null,information:[],latitude:59.45526329,longitude:-135.3144675,map_thumbnail_image:null,media:null,name:"Frye Bruhn Building",name_description:"Once a refrigerated warehouse for the Frye Bruhn Meat Packing Company, this building is slated for rehabilitation.",primary_audio:null,primary_image:42,type:"Historic Building",services:null},{description:"The Slide Cemetery in Dyea remains a tangible reminder of the Palm Sunday Avalanche, which occurred on April 3, 1898 on the Chilkoot Trail.

It is one of the oldest surviving structures in Skagway and was built circa 1897. It served as the center for all of Moore’s Alaska and Northwest Trading Company business and his personal residence.  Over the years, the building provided office space for the Skagway Chamber of Commerce, the Alaska Road Commission and has housed a hotel, a retail outlet, a bank, law offices, a dentist, and most recently a restaurant and apartments. Today, it is privately owned and was restored under guidance of the National Historic Landmark Technical Assistance program.  Who was Captain Moore? Moore was born in Emden, Germany on March 30, 1822. As an adult, he was in almost every Pacific Coast gold rush from California to the Klondike. Skagway provided his final success. After completing an exploration of White Pass with Skookum Jim Mason for the Canadian government in 1887, Moore realized the commercial potential of Skagway. He and his son Ben built a log cabin and Skagway’s first wharf. When Skagway became the gateway to the Klondike 10 years later, Moore’s prediction about a gold rush to Alaska and the Yukon came true.
