Although her gravestone reads \"wife of John Brown of Harpers Ferry\", Mary A. Brown should be remembered for her personal sacrifices and contributions to the Underground Railroad movement and the abolition of slavery in the United States.  The Brown family homes in Springfield, Massachusetts and North Elba, New York were used to shelter freedom seekers.  Those who heard of John Brown' support found direct, practical and sympathetic assistance, whether he was at home or away. Mary was active in assisting freedom seekers who were directed to her home, sharing limited family resources, and the risk of possible persecution and prosecution for involvement with her husband's illegal activities.  Mary and her family suffered poverty and hardship as a result of John Brown's frequent absences from home.  Food and money were in short supply and sickness and death were a part of her life.  In 1963, researcher Dr. Clarence Gee of Lockport, NY told wrote the following to Kansas City Times writer Velma West Sykes, \"It is all true, the hardships she endured, that you have found in your research.  But in nothing she ever said or in any of her actions is there any criticism expressed about her husband for the privations suffered by her and her family.\"\n\nIn 1839, Mary and the older Brown children took an oath of secrecy and commitment to fight against slavery.  As she told abolitionist friends in November, 1859, while making her way to Virginia to see her husband before his hanging on December 2:  \"He had been waiting twenty years for some opportunity to free the slaves; we had all been waiting with him the proper time when he should put his resolve into action.\"  Mary's sons, Oliver and Watson, were killed during this raid. Mary Brown was associated with notable figures of the Underground Railroad movement, including Geritt Smith, Frederick Douglass, J. Miller McKim, William Still, David Ruggles, Wendell Phillips, Frank Sanborn and Thomas W. Higginson.  Before his execution, Brown appealed to his abolitionist friends to look after his family.  Following the execution of her husband in 1859, Mary and her family frequently endured social ostracism, threats and physical danger from those seeking retribution for the actions of John Brown.  The surviving family members became de facto freedom seekers who made a perilous 3,000 mile journey from New York to California to secure their safety and freedom of opportunity.  In California after 1864, Mary first settled in Red Bluff.  Daughter Annie was employed as a teacher in the colored school.    Mary Brown's last home, purchased with community assistance led by the San Jose Mercury was in Saratoga, California.

One noteworthy incident occurred in February 1859, as John Brown, with the help of others, transported a dozen freedom seekers across the ferry. The river crossing is an appropriate place to commemorate this association with the Underground Railroad in Southwestern Iowa.

After years of financial struggle the Wesleyans brought fellow abolitionist Rev. Jonathan Blanchard to take leadership of the struggling institution. Blanchard was one of Theodore Dwight Weld's Seventy and a conductor on the Underground Railroad in Cincinnati and Western Illinois. According to a memoir by Ezra Cook in Charles Clark's History of the Thirty-Ninth Regiment Illinois Volunteer Veteran Infantry (published under the auspices of the Veteran Association of the Regiment in 1889), \"…runaway slaves were perfectly safe in the College building, even when no attempt was made to conceal their presence….With hundreds of others, I have seen and talked with such fugitives in the college chapel. Of course they soon took a night train well-guarded to the next station on the U. G. R. R.\" (p. 490). Cook provides the first \"hard\" evidence to support the claims of Underground Railroad activity occurring on campus. In 1859, Blanchard renamed the school Wheaton College, which is still in existence, to honor benefactor and Illinois Institute trustee Warren L.

Each spring Matson would bring some of his slaves to Illinois to work his Illinois farm and then take them back to Kentucky in the fall after the crops were harvested. One family fearing the wife and children would be sold when they returned to Kentucky fled and sought shelter with well known abolitionists Rutherford and Ashmore. Matson filed a suit against Rutherford and Ashmore in the circuit court under the Black Law, demanding damages in the sum of twenty-five hundred dollars, or five hundred dollars for each slave. This trial became known as the Matson Slave Trial and has been called one of the top 5 Legal Cases in Coles County between 1830-1900. The case was heard in Circuit Court in Charleston in October. The case hinged on the concept that if the slaves were only crossing the state (in transit) they would not be free but if they were located for a time by the consent of the master they would be free.

This play shares one Quaker woman’s story, what brought her to this place, her emotional encounters with the pursued and the pursuers, and why she continued to ask, “Can we standby and let this happen?”", "X_1": -85.922448, "Y_1": 39.202897 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -85.922447391233334, 39.202896687533212 ] } },

Floyd County is in a very unique spot in that it stretches thirteen miles along the Ohio River across from Louisville, Kentucky. There were, therefore, border problems and ensuing complications for slaves who attempted to cross the river through this metropolitan area. Slave catchers and police worked together and easily crossed the river using the ferry and railroad systems. Therefore, escape through this area was very difficult. Newspapers frequently reported on capture of runaway slaves in this southern Indiana region. This program conveys the problems but also gives documented examples of slaves who were able to escape through Floyd County on their own as well as with the help of local citizens. The free African American community was primarily responsible for assistance, but help also came from white, anti-slavery church members.\nThe program also emphasizes the fact that the Underground Railroad was still in operation in this area after President Lincoln gave the Emancipation Proclamation. Because Kentucky was a Union state, the proclamation did not apply to Kentucky slaves. Many slaves ignored that fact, however. Between January 1, 1863, and the end of the Civil War, Floyd County was flooded with fugitives from slavery. The Indiana Exclusion Act of 1851 was not rescinded until 1866. That coupled with the fact that bias against blacks continued to exist, meant that benevolent activity of any kind toward runaway slaves and contraband families had to be suppressed.

The plantation, located in Kent County, Maryland, was owned by Samuel Jarman. Tillotson ran away from Jarman in 1857, during a religious camp-meeting, because he was afraid he would be sold to Georgia upon the death of his master. Tillotson traveled north on the Underground Railroad, hiding in barns and coming close to being captured. He made it to Philadelphia where his account was recorded by William Still and sent on to St. Catharines, Ontario. While in Canada he became an active member of his community and his life story was recorded by a neighboring white man, Fred Parnell. This case highlights many elements of the Underground Railroad and the abolition movement. Still's account and Tillotson's own describe Jarman differently.

In 1851, the tavern was the gathering place where various Gorsuch relatives met and set off for Christiana in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, to recapture enslaved African Americans from the Edward Gorsuch place, “Retreat Farm,” across the road and west of the tavern. It is the best site in Baltimore County to commemorate the story of a significant escape from slavery and the effort of a master to recapture his bondsmen by force. This confrontation resulted in a celebrated trial in Philadelphia that inflamed the tensions already existing between north and south after the compromise of 1850. With the aid of the U. S. Deputy Marshal, the Gorsuch party tracked down the whereabouts of the runaways in Christiana. When the Gorsuch party arrived in Christiana, they encountered armed resistance to taking the freedom seekers back to Maryland; at an obviously planned signal, a biracial group came to the rescue of the freedom seekers and their host.

After selling the house in 1852, he remained in Florence for the rest of his life. Two years later, the wife of fugitive orator and Methodist minister Thomas H.

Who were these ordinary people who paved the path to freedom? How did the enslaved seek and gain freedom in a border state? Where did people go once they left Maryland? How was the Chesapeake Bay used by both freedom seekers and slave catchers during the quest for freedom? Heritage travelers, scholars, teachers, and students will discover how ordinary people in a southern slaveholding community faced extraordinary challenges to help others secure their freedom.", "X_1": -70.926997, "Y_1": 41.635025 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.609275454397903, 39.286596383517349 ] } },

Period newspaper advertisements provide evidence of at least one freedom seeker in 1780, and of a kidnapping of a freeman's son by a Caucasian man in the 1800's. After the Johnsons retired from the iron industry, the Catoctin Iron Furnace went through several owners and technological changes and continued to operate until 1903.

Wardrop’s 20-acre residential complex included a substantial brick dwelling house and outbuildings, orchards, livestock and an ornamental garden. Throughout its history, the site has served as the town-home of many prominent tobacco merchants.\n\nDarnall’s Chance is significant to Underground Railroad history because the site depended on the labor of enslaved African Americans for more than a century. Through runaway slave advertisements, historians have been able to identify eight enslaved individuals who ran away from Darnall’s Chance. John Hodges who owned Darnall’s Chance from 1799 until 1825 placed two runaway slave advertisements for a man named William and his wife Nancy who ran away from Darnall’s Chance in 1820. Horatio Scott who owned the house from 1832 until 1857 placed fourteen advertisements in the local newspapers calling for the capture of five individuals who ran away from Darnall’s Chance: Basil Duppin, Leander, Camilla Dent, Louisa and John Dent.

In the lower west courtroom one of the most important cases ever tried in the United States began. In 1847 and again in 1850, a slave named Dred Scott and his wife Harriet sued for, and were granted, their freedom. Appeals to higher courts by their owner took their freedom away, and led to the momentous Supreme Court decision of 1857, which upheld the ruling that they should remain slaves, and declared the Missouri Compromise of 1820 unconstitutional. The Dred Scott Decision hastened the start of the Civil War. It is also the most famous of thousands of civil suits launched by slaves throughout the United States in the antebellum period to try to gain their freedom through the action of the courts. As such it represents another avenue toward freedom for slaves other than manumission or flight. The Old Courthouse stands only two blocks from the Gateway Arch and contains restored courtrooms, museum exhibits on the Dred Scott Decision, historical dioramas, and the headquarters of Jefferson National Expansion Memorial. Ranger-led tours are available at scheduled times, as are public programs on civil rights and slavery. Mock trials highlight the struggles of Dred and Harriet Scott for their freedom as well as lesser-known cases like that of Lucy Delaney, a 12 year old girl who sued for her freedom three years before the Scotts, or Caroline Williams, who challenged St. Louis’ segregation policies on public transportation in 1869.", "X_1": -90.188811, "Y_1": 38.625272 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -90.188810272175544, 38.625271592810861 ] } },

Abigail later became involved with William Still of the Vigilant Committee of the Philadelphia Branch of the Underground Railroad. By 1830s she was a well-known abolitionist. Due in part to her efforts many slaves living in Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia were aware of this region as a safe haven for runaways. She Urged Quaker friends in the Salem area to donate food, clothing, and money to give to runaway slaves. She gave food, clothing and money to the runaways and continually solicited these items from neighbors and friends. A contemporary of Goodwin wrote, “Abby denied herself even the necessary apparel and few beggars came to our doors whose garments were so worn, forlorn, and patched-up as Abby’s. She also made clothing for runways and wrote, “I should like to know if the fugitives are mostly large…I want to know in regard to the clothes that I intend making…They ought to be fitted out for Canada with strong, warm clothing in cold weather, and their sad fate alleviated as much as can be.” She took a personal interest in individual slaves, even going so far as to purchase slaves and set them free, a practice that was not sanctioned by the abolitionist organizations she belonged. Goodwin wrote, “I don’t like buying them, or giving money to the slave-holders either; but this seems to be a peculiar case, can be had so cheap, and so many young ones that would be separated from their parents.” In 1872, noted abolitionist leader, William Still published his book “The Underground Railroad.” In a section devoted to the story of Abigail Goodwin, Still wrote, “Abigail Goodwin, of Salem, N.J. was one of the rare, true friends to the Underground Rail Road, whose labors entitle her name to be mentioned in terms of very high praise.” The current owner of the house on Market Street is a direct decendent of the Goodwin family.", "X_1": -75.465713, "Y_1": 39.575195 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -75.465712020592491, 39.575194551388506 ] } },

Citizens of Saratoga and surrounding areas were instrumental in arranging for Solomon's release in 1853 and return to Saratoga. Mr. Northup published his autobiography Twelve Years A Slave in 1853 about his ordeal. It is believed he traveled throughout the region selling his book and speaking out against slavery and was himself an abolitionist. Although Mr. Northup sought to bring his captors to trial, they were never prosecuted and he mysteriously disappeared. To date, his burial site has not been identified and it is not known whether or not he was killed, re-captured or died of natural causes. The city of Saratoga Springs has installed a marker near his capture site and since 1999,there has been an annual Solomon Northup Day recognized by the North Country Underground Railroad Historical Association. These annual educational programs have focused on New York's African American history of the Underground Railroad.", "X_1": -73.394862, "Y_1": 44.693749 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -73.394861349171094, 44.693748717830147 ] } },

This dramatic escape story earned them the nickname of the “Dover Eight.” Elliott later joined John Brown in St. Catharine’s, Ontario, but did not go to Harper’s Ferry.

European American abolitionist members of this meeting included the Slocum and Hannah Howland family, David and Edna Thomas, Isaac and Susan Jacobs, Susannah Marriott, and Joseph and Sarah Tallcott. In November 1837, the Cayuga County Anti-Slavery Society held one of its first meetings here (having been refused space in the Presbyterian Church in Aurora). “The meeting was well attended principally by the Friends who are numerous in this quarter and quite generally abolitionists,” reported the Friend of Man, newspaper of the New York State Anti-Slavery Society. In 1843, Garrisonian abolitionist Abby Kelley spoke here, as part of her tour of New York State. In 1850, the meeting helped raise bail money for William Chaplin, jailed in Maryland for attempting to rescue people from slavery.

David Putnam of Palestine August 13, 1898 Mr. Putnam states “At the Greenville Negro settlement was another station. The Clemens and the Alexander’s were the leaders in the movement there. These were Negro families.” The Clemens are listed as Darke County operators in Appendix E (Directory of the Names of Underground Railroad Operators) in Wilbert H. Sierbert’s The Underground Railroad from Slavery to Freedom. Also in the manuscript is a letter from Jno. Reily Knox dated on August 7, 1884 to Professor Siebert Mr. Knox that states “The hunters visited Greenville, and after consultation with a certain law firm, they went in the night to the colored settlement and searched several cabins.” In a 1981 letter from Mrs. Kenton Dye of Winchester Indiana to Mrs. Toni Seller the Director of the Garest Museum, Mrs. Kenton writes that she talked to Maze Clemens a descendant of James Clemens. He stated to her that “His grandfather escorted runaway slaves from Newport (now Fountain City, Indiana) to Longtown where they were hidden all day before being transported to Paulding, Ohio, where it was assumed they were safe.”", "X_1": -84.783553, "Y_1": 40.077653 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -84.783551718536216, 40.077653349023933 ] } },

This pioneering railroad was the eastern-most segment of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s statewide, 390-mile-long Main Line of Public Works. By the late 1830s, this same eastern segment also became one of the most secretive and expeditious transportation corridors for formerly enslaved people to reach freedom in the care of the Vigilance Committee in the City of Philadelphia. African American entrepreneurs William Whipper and Stephen Smith of Columbia owned and operated railroad box cars which were routinely used to transport freight from their successful businesses to and from Philadelphia. Some of these box cars, according to Whipper and other credible sources, were “peculiarly constructed with hidden compartments for carrying freight belonging to the Underground Railroad.” One account states that no freedom seekers were ever detected using this transport system. Columbia’s burgeoning industrial riverfront on the Susquehanna provided employment for large numbers of African Americans as early as circa 1820. This community emerged as a magnet for freedom seekers and humanitarians supporting the anti-slavery cause. Slave catchers were also a constant threat during these years. One abolitionist, William Wright, a Quaker, is widely credited with organizing the system of overland transport of freedom seekers from one Friends’ family home or farm to another, a distance of about 10 miles apart, or the distance one could travel overnight by foot or wagon.

This incident led to the slave owners having to appear in court, and eventually to the illegal imprisonment of the fugitives. At the trial a riot broke out in front of the courthouse, leading to the death of one of the slave owners and the escape of the freedom seekers. Also in 1847, the Kaufman Case was heard at the courthouse. This case was about Daniel Kaufman's work on the Underground Railroad and his aiding thirteen fugitives at his home in Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania.

This voyage was one of roughly a thousand transatlantic slaving ventures launched by Rhode Islanders in the colonial and early national period, and one of the deadliest. Of the 196 Africans acquired by the ship's master, Esek Hopkins, at least 109 perished, some in a failed insurrection, others by suicide, starvation, and disease.  The insurrection is documented in the exhibit and the account has been reproduced and enlarged from the original journal.

Eight members are said to have kept safehouses on the Underground Railroad either before or after their time at the NAEI. One of these men, Samuel L. Hill, arranged to purchase Ross Homestead (then the Theodore Burt house) in 1841, merging it with other founders’ property to form the 470 acres of the NAEI.
