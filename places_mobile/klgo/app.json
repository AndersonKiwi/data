Main body text: Since prehistoric times, the coastal Tlingit Natives traded extensively with the inland Tagish First Nations using the Chilkoot corridor beginning at nearby Dyea. The White Pass corridor that began in Skagway was also used, but not as extensively. These routes allowed trade and cultural exchange to develop between peoples on both sides of the mountains. The Tlingit were not the only people to see the advantages of these corridors. Euroamerican prospectors began using the Chilkoot Trail in the 1880s to search for gold in the interior. In 1887, Skookum Jim (Keish), a Tagish man, guided Captain William Moore over the White Pass. That autumn, the Captain, his son Ben, and a Tlingit helper, Nan Suk, began building a wharf and cabin in what became Skagway. Captain Moore saw Skagway's potential with its deep water harbor and access to the interior. He believed many gold discoveries would occur in the north, and he intended to capitalize on the migration of people. With this in mind, Ben Moore filed a 160-acre land claim and both father and son began developing what was to become Skagway--the Gateway to the Interior. Historic photograph of Tlingit woman hiking.

Brackett, it proved to be a tremendous improvement over the miserable “Trail of 1897.” Brackett had hoped to extend his road to White Pass summit, but lack of money and the construction of the railroad doomed his efforts.The road was popular with packers and proved to be immensely helpful during railroad construction. However, many chafed at the fees Brackett charged and “toll gate wars” ensued over payment. Finally, after anticipating financial ruin, Brackett sold the road to the railroad for $100,000 in June, 1898. He continued to collect toils, however, until early 1899.",

The noise, hustle, and bustle of this port town rivaled that of much larger settlements. Tlingit packers began their trading expeditions here and a village was established with a trading post run by John J. Healy and Edgar Wilson in 1884. The tiny hamlet quickly grew into a town of approximately 8,000 people as fortune seekers who chose Dyea as their entry point to reach the Yukon Territory gold fields off-loaded tons of supplies in the boomtown of Dyea. The town's shallow harbor and inadequate port facilities, a devastating avalanche which occurred up the Chilkoot Trail on April 3, 1898, and the ending of the Klondike Gold Rush itself were reasons for its eventual decline. The final blow to Dyea came that same year with the construction of the 110-mile White Pass & Yukon Route Railway, linking Skagway to Whitehorse, Canada. By 1902, the Dyea post office closed and only a few families homesteaded here. A road to Skagway was completed in 1948, opening up access for another kind of transit -- the tourist.",

Text: Haa Daakaanóox’u is Tlingit for “our outer shell.” It often refers to the things that protect us, and is seen like the eggshell around a newborn bird. While it keeps that newly created life safe, it is delicate. That is often how we refer to our culture and the relationships we have to one another. In the way that we treat things lie the definitions of who we are and what we have ultimately become because of the teachings of those who came before us. Haa Shagóon is how we refer to our ancestors, which can be translated to “our tools of life.” The most important lesson they have left us with is to respect all things, living and dead, large and small. To do this, to whole-heartedly do this, requires a person to place all things before themselves; which is the true spirit of a warrior. Many times throughout history, the Native people of North America have been portrayed as fierce warriors. The image of our warriors is not often as protectors, but as killers. Our warriors, x’eigaa káa, are brave and humble enough to know that they must have respect for all things. To know this is to know our people. In our language, in our culture, the relationship between things is most important. The way a person interacts and fits within their world is their most important journey. To truly be Tlingit, one must understand this,  especially towards things that are helpless or delicate. This is what we strive for within our cultural life. Quote: \"Aaa. Ch’a yéi gugénk’ áwé a kaax shukaylis’úx haa tlagu  wáanx’i aadéi s kunoogu yé.\" Quote by Kichnáalx, Sheet’ká. Quote: \"Yes.

From here, stampeders carried loads of supplies up the famous Chilkoot Trail and over the pass to the headwayers of the Yukon River.

Even before these attacks, the U.S. Army recognized Alaska's strategic location and began using the White Pass and Yukon Route (WP&YR) railroad to supply defense projects in the interior, such as the Alcan (Alaska) Highway, Canol Pipeline, and airfields along the Northwest Staging Route. The WP&YR previously operated two trains daily to Whitehorse, but it now needed to run 17 to 20 trains each day.

Cement, pipe, bulldozers, and approximately 22,000 troops and construction workers passed through the town.

Thousands boarded ships, steamed up Alaska's Inside Passage, and disembarked at Skagway or Dyea. Skagway's  waterfront was a chaotic scene of pitched tents, shouting stampeders, neighing horses, and barking dogs. Streets were quickly laid out, buildings and wharves constructed, and the town even boasted of having electricity, telephone service, and running water. To reach the Klondike, stampeders had to choose between two routes. One was the 33-mile Chilkoot Trail out of Dyea, containing a torturous thousand-foot-climb known as the Golden Staircase. The alternative was the 45-mile White Pass Trail, starting in Skagway. It was infamously named the Dead Horse Trail because pack animals were pushed to the limit. Both trails met near Bennet, British Columbia, where many of the stampeders built or bought boats and waited for the ice to break up. They then floated 550 miles though the lake systems and the Yukon River to reach Dawson City, Canada. Historic photograph of hikers on the Golden Staircase superimposed on background image.

      "alt": "Ch'aagu Daax, Lingit Aani Aya, From Long Ago, This Has Been Tlingit Land. Text: The history of Shgagwei (Skagway), Deiyaa (Dyea), and A Shakee (Chilkoot Trail/Chilkoot Pass) is complex. Like many places throughout the United States, what was viewed as discovery and opportunity for wealth from the perspective of American culture was the invasion of the traditional territory of an indigenous population. Many organizations celebrate the gold rush of Alaska without recognizing that it marked a time of tremendous suffering, loss, and oncoming oppression for Skagway's first people. The Tribe in Skagway is attempting to bridge the gaps that exist in and around our community from a Tribal perspective. Over the last hundred years, the physical and cultural landscape of this area has changed dramatically. This place was once a vital bridge between Coastal and Interior indigenous groups, who relied upon routes into the interior to trade the riches of the sea for those of the land. Inland groups savored preserved salmon, fish, and seal oils, and sea vegetation; and bartered with invaluable copper, moose and caribou meat and hides. The coming of the gold rush and breakup of traditional Native territory divided families, clans, and traditions. Traditional land ownership included Tlingit control of the Chilkoot Trail and the recognized right to charge outsiders (such as other Natives and \"stampeders\") fees for access to it. Attempts to protect these ancestral rights have been portrayed as a jealous effort to retain monopoly of the Chilkoot Trail. This perspective ignores the historical oppression of this area's Native people and demeans them for having tried to protect everything they once had. Skagway Traditional Council and Carcross/Tagish First Nations (CTFN) have begun to address and resolve cross-border issues including traditional trading practices, historical migration patterns, and the use of the Chilkoot Trail. The Native peoples' losses have not been properly acknowledged in light of what brought wealth to the newcomers of this rugged land. Through this project, the creation of signs from the perspective of the Tribe as a joint Federal-Tribal effort, the hope exists that this trail, which has become a difficult symbol for a people divided, may once again become a symbol of unity, growth, and sharing for all the people who live within its shadow. Quote: \"We look forward to a time when we will have, as promise, an equal partnership as stewards of this place that is so important to both of our histories, and so important to our history together... Our people have much to offer the Yukon Territory, Canada, and the United States. It will be good to honor together how our heritages meet 100 years ago. It will be good to repair what has been damaged and move forward together.  It will be good to see this trail and this land cared for the in ways of our tradition... It will be good to see people moving in our land who respect and understand the difficult heritage we share. It will be good to see those people moving in our land with peacefulness, and with hope that we can make such a difficult symbol, the Chilkoot Trail, good for all of us again.\" Quote by CTFN Chief Andy Carvill, Gold Rush Centennial, 1998.

      "alt": "International Boundary: By 1898, the Klondike Gold Rush was in full swing and its potential wealth rekindled a boundary dispute between the United States and Canada. The border, vaguely defined in an 1825 treaty between Russia and Great Britain, remained unclear when the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. With thousands of stampeders using the White Pass and Chilkoot Trails, both countries laid claim to the boom towns of Skagway and Dyea. In February 1898, a surprise move by the Canadian government ensured that both the White and Chilkoot passes would be controlled by Canada. The North - West Mounted Police were quietly sent to both summits, where they established posts and began collecting customs duties. Each post was equipped with a Maxim machine gun, ammunition, and supplies for six months.  This bold move established a de facto boundary across the disputed territory and helped control the flow of people to Canada. The final boundary line was set in 1903 after much debate by the Alaska Boundary Tribunal.  Quote by Clifford Sifton, Minister of Finance, Canada, and April 1898: It was a case of possession being ten points in for the law, and we intend to hold possession.

      "alt": "U.S. Army Invades Skagway. Text: During April 1942, the sleepy little town of Skagway was startled awake by the sudden arrival of thousands of American troops. Text: Alaska was thrown into the spotlight in June 1942 after the Japanese bombed Dutch Harbor and invaded Attu and Kiska islands in the Aleutian archipelago. Even before these attacks, the U.S. Army recognized Alaska's strategic location and began using the White Pass and Yukon Route (WP&YR) railroad to supply defense projects in the interior, such as the Alcan (Alaska) Highway, Canol Pipeline, and airfields along the Northwest Staging Route. The WP&YR previously operated two trains daily to Whitehorse, but it now needed to run 17 to 20 trains each day. The 770th Railway Operating Battalion took command of the railroad line spanning 110 miles of tough terrain. Conditions were often extreme, leading Private Howard Foley to state, \"That line's too steep for a goat and too cold for a polar bear.\" As many as 5,000 people were stationed in Skagway where Quonset huts sprouted like weeds in vacant lots and the Army took over many existing buildings. Cement, pipe, bulldozers, and approximately 22,000 troops and construction workers passed through the town. After the war ended in 1946, the WP&YR and Skagway residents resumed peacetime operations, proud of the transportation role they played during World War II.

      "alt": "Ách Áyá Haa Toowú Wlitseen, This Is Why We Gained Strength of Mind. The Death and Rebirth of a Village. Text: This place is the village of Deiyáa, which can be translated to “Pack Trail”\nand it is a key area of Northern Tlingit country. It is one of many areas that link the coast to the interior, and has been a valuable trade route for the Tlingit people for much longer than written history in this area. According to traditional history, the Tlingit migrated to the coast from the interior in several areas: Shtaxhéen (Stikine River - “Silty River”), T’aawákw Galakú (T’aakú - Taku - “Flooding Geese”), Naadaashaahéeni (Carcross\n- “Water Flowing off the Mountain”), Lkóot (Chilkoot - “The Lake that Puked”), and Jilkáat (Chilkat - “Food Cache”). While Shgagwéi (Skagway - “Roughed up or bunched up water” or\n“Whitecaps”) served mostly as an area for seasonal hunting and fishing camps, Deiyáa was a village that local elders have described as smaller than Deishú (Haines - “End of the Trail”) and Tlákw Aan (Klukwan - “Eternal Village”). It was a place for families who did not want to live in a village with several hundred residents. This area was occupied by families from Deishú, Tlákw Aan, and Naadaashaahéeni. The primary clans in the area are Lukaax.ádi (Raven-Sockeye), Kaagwaantaan (Eagle-Wolf ), Deisheetaan (Raven-Beaver), Dakl’aweidí (Eagle-Killer Whale) and Yanyeidí (Wolf ). There was a time when dugout canoes made of cedar or cottonwood lined the beaches of Deiyáa. Valuable foods from the sea like salmon, eulachon, seaweeds, seal, and clams, as well as seal and eulachon grease, were packed into the interior. These foods are collectively referred to as Haa Shagóon Atxáyi (“Our Ancestor’s Food”) and are central to the culture of the Tlingit people. They were traded with interior Tlingit and other Tribes for moose, beaver, copper, mountain goat, and mountain sheep. Today, they remain an important part of the traditional lifestyle, ceremony, and diet of the Tlingit people.The village of Deiyáa vanished beneath the stampede of the gold rush. With an influx of over 10,000 foreigners, the landscape was forever changed. A rapid decline in traditional\nTlingit presence, rights, and activities in the area began, and has\ncontinued ever since. Tribal activity has resurged in the area as the Skagway Traditional Council is working to revitalize their cultural ties to the land and to their ancestral partnership with the Carcross/Tagish First Nations of Canada. Skagway is in many ways symbolic of the fate of the Tlingit people. Where traditions and cultural activity were once dormant or dissipating, they are resurging and becoming more visible and shared. In turn, the community is recognizing the value of understanding this knowledge, whose origin pre-dates any written history. Quote: \"Tsu heidei shugaaxtootaan yaa yakoosge daakeit a jeex’ anak has kawdikeet.\" Quote by: Kichnáalx, Sheet’ká. Quote: We will once again open this container of wisdom left in our care.\" Quote by: George Davis, Sitka. The ways of the Tlingit culture are based on cultural knowledge, respect, and a tradition of loving\nand helping one another. Today, there are children and adults working to learn the Tlingit language, which has been ranked as one of the most difficult languages in the world. Through these efforts, more of the culture will be understood, given life again,\nand taught to future generations. The most important fact to retain is that the Tlingit people of Skagway are here today and forever, reviving their culture, telling their own story, and honoring ancestors who created the Tlingit history of this traditional land.

Enthusiastic about what he saw, Moore homesteaded Skagway and eventually built the White Pass Trail, which he declared opened on July 14, 1897.At first considered a lower elevation alternative to the nearby Chilkoot Trail, White Pass Trail never reached its potential. Instead, rains in the Fall of 1897 and the influx of hundreds of inexperienced stampeders and their pack animals transformed the trail into a quagmire. The carcasses of over 3,000 animals soon turned White Pass into the Deadhorse Trail. The trail was soon superseded by the Brackett Wagon Road and later the railroad. \nThough the trail is no longer visible, the entrance to part of it, Dead Horse Gulch, can be seen below the railroad in the far left distance.",

      "alt": "Deiyaa (Dyea) Text: Long before the famous Klondike Gold Rush, Tlingit people established Deiyaa (Dyea) as an important village and access point to the interior. The word Deiyaa means \"to pack.\" Shaa Shakee (the Chilkoot Trail) started here and crossed one of the few ice-free passes available for hundreds of miles. The Taiya Inlet was used as a transportation corridor between major villages like Tlakw Aan (Klukwan) and smaller outlying villages like Deiyaa. Travel by yaakw (canoe) was necessary as no overland trains between these locations existed. Many of the place names we use today, like Yaakw Deiyaa.aa (Yakutania Point) which means \"place to pack your canoe,\" are derived from the Tlingit language. Families frequently traveled the inlet and rivers to collect food and medicinal plants. Each spring, small fish called eulachon were rendered into oil that was used for cooking and medicine. Cranberries, seaweed, mussels, mountain goats and fish were also harvested. Many of these products were not available to the people of the interior and were packed over the trail to trade for meat and hides of moose and caribou. Traders' packs were also laden with plant products from the interior and perhaps gifts from relatives. Fishing for eulachon, collecting of plant materials, and trade with the interior continue to be part of family traditions among Native people of the area.",

Imagine the raw power and deafening roar of a 129-ton rotary snowplow as its curcular blades carve through deep snow drifts with the same ease as a knife cutting through soft butter. The Cooke Rotary Snowplow, designated \"No. 1\" by railroad crewmen, often performed that task. The White Pass, at 2,865 feet, receives significant snowfall from late September until early June. Snowplow No. 1, built in 1899, was well suited to serve the early needs of the White Pass &Yukon Route, even during the harshest winter conditions. The boiler of No. 1 was used solely to turn the 10-foot rotary blades of the plow. The snowplow itself was pushed forward by two locomotives coupled behind the plow. Together, the dynamo was able to slice through 12-foot-high snow drifts.",

It stretches back 60 feet from street, and a simple pitched, shingled roof tops the building behind its false front.  Soapy’s is located on the south side of Second Avenue, between State Street and Broadway.  A metal fence five feet high separates the building from the boardwalk.  Grassy areas on both sides of the structure set it apart from the neighboring buildings.  The exterior walls on either side of the building are windowless..  Soapy’s is not currently open to the public. \n        \nThe building’s wooden, flat-topped facade is painted white, except for a black strip about a foot wide across the top, just below the roofline.  The words “Jeff. Smiths Parlor” have been stenciled in white capital letters on the black strip, but are badly faded.  A single windowed doorway is set into the right-hand side of the façade; a large square window is located immediately to its left.  The window and door, both trimmed in beige, together stretch across almost the entire width of the building.  White lace curtains adorn the window and door from inside.\n\nEnd of message.\n",
      "description": "Jeff Smith's Parlor was the saloon and headquarters of Jefferson Randolph Smith, better known as 'Soapy Smith.' Smith was Skagway’s most infamous con-man, who arrived in Skagway sometime in 1897 and began operating from this building on 6th Avenue, May 1898. The interior during Soapy’s reign has been described as a restaurant with a large mahogany bar. The back room 'parlor' was where victims were sometimes robbed while gang members ran away with the loot. Soapy met his demise soon after J. D. Stewart, a gold miner returning from the Klondike, was robbed by his gang. Soapy was killed in a shoot-out by Frank Reid on July 8, 1898 and both are buried in Skagway’s Gold Rush Cemetery. In the years following Soapy’s death, this false-front wood-frame building changed hands several times.  As new owner Martin Itjen took over in 1935, restoration efforts and improvements soon followed, based on historical photographs.  Itjen reconstructed the building to a version of what Soapy’s Parlor had been, and papered the interior walls with newspapers dating from the gold rush to the 1930s. When he reopened the building as a museum, Itjen used his wizardry at mechanics and installed a manikin of Soapy Smith that turned from the bar and greeted visitors to the museum.  The Jeff. Smith Parlor Museum became a highlight on his Skagway tours. Upon Itjen’s death in 1924, George Rapuzzi, a collector of gold rush memorabilia, and Itjen’s long-time friend, took over the museum and moved the building to the current location in 1964. With his wife Edna, George repaired and renovated the building which was open to the public from 1967 to 1986.  In December 2008, the Rasmuson Foundation donated the ‘George and Edna Rapuzzi Collection,’ which included five historic buildings and a large collection of artifacts from 1898 through the late 1960’s to the National Park Service. Original artifacts and memorabilia depicting Soapy Smith’s life in Skagway will be on display when restoration is completed in 2016.",

Constructed in 1887-1888 by Captain Moore, his son, Ben, and Nan-Suk, a Tlingit native, it is the oldest structure in town. Original newspapers from the late nineteenth century, once used as interior decoration, still adhere to the walls and ceiling of the cabin. \n\nCaptain Moore was a veteran of gold rushes. He predicted that there would one day be a great gold rush in the Yukon and Alaska and that stampeders would make their way up the Skagway River Valley to get there. He and his son claimed a homestead, built a cabin, and constructed a wharf. When the rush finally came, his land was overrun by a flood of stampeders. Nevertheless, Captain William Moore and his family prospered, and he lived to see his homestead turn into a significant port and railroad town. The life of Ben Moore exemplifies the pioneer spirit of Alaska. \n\nAs a young man he plied the Inside Passage and traveled up and down the Yukon River, looking for gold and working at various jobs in fishing, mining, and packing. Ben Moore married Klinget-Sai-Yet, daughter of a Tlingit leader, and named her Minnie. In 1897 he began constructing a frame house just south of his father's cabin. This small beginning became the nucleus of the present Ben Moore House. Over the years, continued additions and remodeling created a sizeable home. By 1907 Ben Moore and his family moved to Tacoma, Washington. The house was rented by jeweler Herman Kirmse and later purchased by his wife Hazel in 1914. Today the house is open to the public and depicts life in a pioneer home around 1904.",

      "description": "During the early gold rush years in Skagway, this building was associated with one of two businesses that provided retail and wholesale meat to stampeders and commercial clients.  \n\nKnown as the Frye-Bruhn refrigerated warehouse, it was owned by brothers Frank and Charles Frye and Charles Bruhn and was part of the Frye-Bruhn Meat Packing Company, of Seattle, Washington.  \n\nIncorporated in 1891, the company rapidly expanded during the gold rush and soon had stores in several locations in Alaska including Haines, Juneau, Seward, Skagway, Valdez, and a cattle ranch in Katmai. This building, part of the Frye-Bruhn meat packing empire, was first used briefly as a slaughter house.  It was remodeled in May 1900 and turned into a refrigerated warehouse for meat.  The Frye-Bruhn Company sold the warehouse in September 1919 to Anthony Dortero, a Skagway fruit dealer and clothier to men, for $450, but continued to operate in Skagway until the mid-1930s.  Mr. Dortero died in 1920 but his widow, Sabina, kept the property until 1945.  After that it was owned by several people before being donated to the National Park Service. \n\nExactly when the refrigeration equipment in the old building stopped working is unknown but it still contains parts of the original refrigeration coils and overhead track used to keep the meat cool and to move it around.  What is the future of the warehouse? The National Park Service recently moved it across 5th Avenue to where you see it now. The next step is to decide whether it should stay here or be moved to another location and stabilize it. Research and preservation work will need to be done to save the warehouse and put it back into use either as a storage building, interpretive facility, or commercial lease.",

In two years’ time, Skagway’s population soared from just a handful to over 8,000 people and creating bountiful opportunities to start businesses and sell goods and services. \n\nStampeder and entrepreneur Henry Boas constructed this building in September 1899, out of which he operated a tailor shop and fur business until 1903. This shop fits the stereotypical appearance of a western boomtown false front building, common in Gold Rush era architecture in Skagway. \n\nTo grab the attention of thousands of potential customers, elaborate false fronts such as this projected an image of size, prosperity, and stability. A look at the roofline from the side will reveal its false front, which masked the simple, gabled-roof building behind. The use of this structure is also common to false-front structures in Skagway; a small shop on the first floor and the shopkeeper’s residence upstairs. \n\nThe history of Boas Tailor and Furrier Shop mirror’s Skagway’s up-and-down, boom-and-bust frontier economy. Today it is part of the National Park Service’s Lease Back program, and is rented by a private business.",

Near the trail’s end, the climb eases, and the route follows Dewey Creek closely for a short way. It finally emerges from the trees into a muskeg meadow, where there are views of Mt. Harding and the inlet below. A primitive cabin sits by the lake and is open to the public. Follow the trail to the left from this cabin across a spillway to a new cabin perched on the northwest end of the lake. This cabin is available for rent through the Skagway Recreation Center (907-983-2679, www.skagwayrecreation.org).

Brought here to protect American territory during the gold rush, the troops departed in 1904 for Fort William Seward in Haines, Alaska. After the barracks was moved to its present location, an open store area was built with a flowing stairway leading upstairs and a new false-front attached. By 1907-1908, Skagway’s glory days of the Klondike Gold Rush had passed. Vacant, derelict buildings lined the streets, giving Skagway the appearance, as described by one visitor, of “the scrap-heap of creation.” In an attempt to centralize businesses in the downtown area and create a new Skagway, several buildings, including this one, were moved to new locations along Broadway in 1908.Partners Lynch & Kennedy were the first owners of the new store and sold men’s attire and dry goods, and theirs is one of the town’s finest examples of false front architecture and reflects the hoped-for stability in Skagway. The local paper, The Daily Alaskan, reported that “The store is just about the handsomest in the city… It is a fine addition to business life of the city.” It remains a fine example of Gold Rush era architecture, and today continues its role in Skagway’s commercial present as part of the National Park Service’s Lease Back Program.",

With thousands of anxious prospectors wildly making their way through Skagway on their way to the Klondike Gold Fields, some could find rest on the many bunks and cots within, and feast on meals served en masse. \n\nAs the Gold Rush era waned, the hotel was remodeled in 1898 to serve as a hardware store. The new owner transformed the shack-like building into a more permanent, sturdy structure and added the false front facing Broadway. Today the Pantheon Saloon is a kid-friendly Junior Ranger Center, where children complete their own journey of the Klondike Gold Rush.",

It served as the center for all of Moore’s Alaska and Northwest Trading Company business and his personal residence.  Over the years, the building provided office space for the Skagway Chamber of Commerce, the Alaska Road Commission and has housed a hotel, a retail outlet, a bank, law offices, a dentist, and most recently a restaurant and apartments. Today, it is privately owned and was restored under guidance of the National Historic Landmark Technical Assistance program.  Who was Captain Moore? Moore was born in Emden, Germany on March 30, 1822. As an adult, he was in almost every Pacific Coast gold rush from California to the Klondike. Skagway provided his final success. After completing an exploration of White Pass with Skookum Jim Mason for the Canadian government in 1887, Moore realized the commercial potential of Skagway. He and his son Ben built a log cabin and Skagway’s first wharf. When Skagway became the gateway to the Klondike 10 years later, Moore’s prediction about a gold rush to Alaska and the Yukon came true. The Portland House is privately owned and was restored under guidance of the National Historic Landmark Technical Assistance program.",

But before that retaining wall was completed the tide washed up passed 4th ave.  The spot you are at now was once part of a pier that jetted out into the water.  \n\nBack then, Jeff 'Soapy' Smith controlled the crime in Skagway. But as more respectable entrepreneurs arrived in town, his control was challenged. The respectable folks in Skagway formed the 'Committee of 101'. This group hoped to rid the town of crime in order to promote more business for the entrepreneurs. \n\nFor several months both Soapy and the committee of 101 posted propaganda promoting themselves. On July 8th 1898 the tension between the two groups came to a head. The committee was holding a meeting on the Warf. Soapy walked onto the pier to challenge them.  Frank Reed and two other members of the Committee were at the front of the pier standing guard.  No one knows exactly what happened next but the result was Soapy Smith shot dead and Frank Reed mortally wounded, succumbing to those wounds 12 days later.  \n\nToday you can visit the resting place of both these men at the Gold Rush Cemetery located just outside of town.\n",

      "description": "Listen for the clinking of bottles, laughter, and chatter from the interior of the Mascot, a Gold Rush-era saloon that supplied alcohol to thirsty stampeders and served as a gathering place where men could play pool, gamble, and listen to music. \n\nOriginally constructed in 1898, a corner entry led to the 'Mascotte' saloon, owned by Charles Rohbak, who sold liquor, cigars, and fresh beer on draft for ten cents. In early 1899, however, a new law came into force as Skagway transitioned from frontier town to family town, requiring Skagway’s saloons to pay a $1,500 license fee in order to remain open. Of the 80 saloons reported open in January 1899, all but a dozen had closed by April, including Rohbak’s 'Mascotte.' After its closure, entrepreneur Albert Reinert and a partner purchased the building, paid the license fee, and began remodeling the interior. As a former restaurant owner, Reinert knew how to keep customers with offers of free lunches including clam chowder, spareribs, enchiladas, and more, along with locally brewed pilsner beer for a nickel a schooner. But moral reforms were sweeping Skagway at the start of the 20th century, and by 1916 Skagway had voted itself a 'dry' town. Impressively, the renamed 'Mascot' was one of only three Gold Rush-era saloons that survived until local prohibition. \n\nEventually Reinert sold the Mascot to Perry Hern, who converted the interior to a pharmacy, and owned the complex for the next thirty years. In 1974 the National Park Foundation acquired the structure from George Rapuzzi and Charles Hermans, and in 1976, building ownership transferred to the National Park Service. The Mascot Saloon was restored to its 1905-1916 appearance and today exhibits within depict town life, and replica beer bottles of the brand distributed by the Mascot during its heyday line the shelves.",

These former 'cribs' were relocated after moral reforms swept Skagway at the turn of the century as it transitioned into a more permanent, working-class community, putting an end to the Red Light District. They were used as living space by the Verbauwhede family behind their shop and a second one was rented to lodgers. Today these are offices for the Park's Protection Officers",

He made minor repairs to the building and extended the false front. The building also served as a grocery store, a restaurant, and a military mess hall during WW II.

As Skagway declined, support for the mission dwindled. By 1911 the building fell into disuse, although it continued to serve as a home for missionaries. In 1937 it was remodeled as a doctor's office and residence. After the National Park Service acquired the building in 1978 the interior was altered to provide housing for park seasonal staff.",
