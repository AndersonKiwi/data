      "audio_description": "<i>test italic</i>\nSoapy's Parlor Museum.  1 ½ minutes.  Jefferson “Soapy” Smith’s parlor is a narrow, one-story building, 15 feet wide.  It stretches back 60 feet from street, and a simple pitched, shingled roof tops the building behind its false front.  Soapy’s is located on the south side of Second Avenue, between State Street and Broadway.  A metal fence five feet high separates the building from the boardwalk.  Grassy areas on both sides of the structure set it apart from the neighboring buildings.  The exterior walls on either side of the building are windowless..  Soapy’s is not currently open to the public. \n\t\nThe building’s wooden, flat-topped façade is painted white, except for a black strip about a foot wide across the top, just below the roofline.  The words “Jeff. Smiths Parlor” have been stenciled in white capital letters on the black strip, but are badly faded.  A single windowed doorway is set into the right-hand side of the façade; a large square window is located immediately to its left.  The window and door, both trimmed in beige, together stretch across almost the entire width of the building.  White lace curtains adorn the window and door from inside.\n\nEnd of message.\n",
      "description": "Jeff. Smiths Parlor” was the saloon and headquarters of Jefferson Randolph Smith, better known as “Soapy Smith.” Smith was Skagway’s most infamous con-man, who arrived in Skagway sometime in 1897 and began operating from this building on 6th Avenue, May 1898. The interior during Soapy’s reign has been described as a restaurant with a large mahogany bar. The back room “parlor” was where victims were sometimes robbed while gang members ran away with the loot. Soapy met his demise soon after J. D. Stewart, a gold miner returning from the Klondike, was robbed by his gang. Soapy was killed in a shoot-out by Frank Reid on July 8, 1898 and both are buried in Skagway’s Gold Rush Cemetery. In the years following Soapy’s death, this false-front wood-frame building changed hands several times.  As new owner Martin Itjen took over in 1935, restoration efforts and improvements soon followed, based on historical photographs.  Itjen reconstructed the building to a version of what Soapy’s Parlor had been, and papered the interior walls with newspapers dating from the gold rush to the 1930s. When he reopened the building as a museum, Itjen used his wizardry at mechanics and installed a manikin of Soapy Smith that turned from the bar and greeted visitors to the museum.  The Jeff. Smith Parlor Museum became a highlight on his Skagway tours. Upon Itjen’s death in 1924, George Rapuzzi, a collector of gold rush memorabilia, and Itjen’s long-time friend, took over the museum and moved the building to the current location in 1964. With his wife Edna, George repaired and renovated the building which was open to the public from 1967 to 1986.  In December 2008, the Rasmuson Foundation donated the ‘George and Edna Rapuzzi Collection,’ which included five historic buildings and a large collection of artifacts from 1898 through the late 1960’s to the National Park Service. Original artifacts and memorabilia depicting Soapy Smith’s life in Skagway will be on display when restoration is completed in 2016.",

      "description": "During the early gold rush years in Skagway, this building was associated with one of two businesses that provided retail and wholesale meat to stampeders and commercial clients.  Known as the Frye-Bruhn refrigerated warehouse, it was owned by brothers Frank and Charles Frye and Charles Bruhn and was part of the Frye-Bruhn Meat Packing Company, of Seattle, Washington.  Incorporated in 1891, the company rapidly expanded during the gold rush and soon had stores in several locations in Alaska including Haines, Juneau, Seward, Skagway, Valdez, and a cattle ranch in Katmai.  This building, part of the Frye-Bruhn meat packing empire, was first used briefly as a slaughter house.  It was remodeled in May 1900 and turned into a refrigerated warehouse for meat.  The Frye-Bruhn Company sold the warehouse in September 1919 to Anthony Dortero, a Skagway fruit dealer and clothier to men, for $450, but continued to operate in Skagway until the mid-1930s.  Mr. Dortero died in 1920 but his widow, Sabina, kept the property until 1945.  After that it was owned by several people before being donated to the National Park Service. Exactly when the refrigeration equipment in the old building quit working is unknown but it still contains parts of the original refrigeration coils and overhead track used to keep the meat cool and to move it around.  What is the future of the warehouse? The National Park Service recently moved it across 5th Avenue to where you see it now. The next step is to decide whether it should stay here or be moved to another location and stabilize it. Research and preservation work will need to be done to save the warehouse and put it back into use either as a storage building, interpretive facility, or commercial lease.",

Martin Itjen, a Gold rush stampeder and Skagway’s premier tour operator bought this house in 1922 and originally stood on piers near Moore’s Wharf.  From that location, Martin and his wife Lucy greeted passing tourists, sold fruit and candies, and booked rides on Itjen’s innovative Skagway Streetcars. As the streetcar toured, Itjen recited poetry and told humorous anecdotes about the town, keeping the gold rush tales alive. The Itjen House was later moved several times to other locations before finding its present home in 1978.

Vacant, derelict buildings lined the streets, giving Skagway the appearance, as described by one visitor, of “the scrap-heap of creation.” In an attempt to centralize businesses in the downtown area and create a new Skagway, several buildings, including this one, were moved to new locations along Broadway in 1908. In 1900 it originally housed the all black Company L, 24th Infantry as a two-story army barracks. Brought here to protect American territory during the gold rush, the troops departed in 1904 for Fort William Seward in Haines, Alaska. After the barracks was moved to its present location, an open store area was built with a flowing stairway leading upstairs and a new false-front attached. Partners Lynch & Kennedy were the first owners of the new store and sold men’s attire and dry goods, and theirs is one of the town’s finest examples of false front architecture and reflects the hoped-for stability in Skagway. The local paper, The Daily Alaskan, reported that “The store is just about the handsomest in the city… It is a fine addition to business life of the city.” It remains a fine example of Gold Rush era architecture, and today continues its role in Skagway’s commercial present as part of the National Park Service’s Lease Back Program.",

In two years’ time, Skagway’s population soared from just a handful to over 8,000 people and creating bountiful opportunities to start businesses and sell goods and services. Stampeder and entrepreneur Henry Boas constructed this building in September 1899, out of which he operated a tailor shop and fur business until 1903. This shop fits the stereotypical appearance of a western boomtown false front building, common in Gold Rush era architecture in Skagway. To grab the attention of thousands of potential customers, elaborate false fronts such as this projected an image of size, prosperity, and stability. A look at the roofline from the side will reveal its false front, which masked the simple, gabled-roof building behind. The use of this structure is also common to false-front structures in Skagway; a small shop on the first floor and the shopkeeper’s residence upstairs. The history of Boas Tailor and Furrier Shop mirror’s Skagway’s up-and-down, boom-and-bust frontier economy.

It served as the center for all of Moore’s Alaska and Northwest Trading Company business and his personal residence.  Over the years, the building provided office space for the Skagway Chamber of Commerce, the Alaska Road Commission and has housed a hotel, a retail outlet, a bank, law offices, a dentist, and most recently a restaurant and apartments. Today, it is privately owned and was restored under guidance of the National Historic Landmark Technical Assistance program.  Who was Captain Moore? Moore was born in Emden, Germany on March 30, 1822. As an adult, he was in almost every Pacific Coast gold rush from California to the Klondike. Skagway provided his final success. After completing an exploration of White Pass with Skookum Jim Mason for the Canadian government in 1887, Moore realized the commercial potential of Skagway. He and his son Ben built a log cabin and Skagway’s first wharf. When Skagway became the gateway to the Klondike 10 years later, Moore’s prediction about a gold rush to Alaska and the Yukon came true. The Portland House is privately owned and was restored under guidance of the National Historic Landmark Technical Assistance program.",

      "description": "The log-cabin home of Captain William Moore marks the birthplace of Skagway. Constructed in 1887-1888 by Captain Moore, his son, Ben, and Nan-Suk, a Tlingit native, it is the oldest structure in town. Original newspapers from the late nineteenth century, once used as interior decoration, still adhere to the walls and ceiling of the cabin. Captain Moore was a veteran of gold rushes. He predicted that there would one day be a great gold rush in the Yukon and Alaska and that stampeders would make their way up the Skagway River Valley to get there. He and his son claimed a homestead, built a cabin, and constructed a wharf. When the rush finally came, his land was overrun by a flood of stampeders. Nevertheless, Captain William Moore and his family prospered, and he lived to see his homestead turn into a significant port and railroad town. The life of Ben Moore exemplifies the pioneer spirit of Alaska. As a young man he plied the Inside Passage and traveled up and down the Yukon River, looking for gold and working at various jobs in fishing, mining, and packing. Ben Moore married Klinget-Sai-Yet, daughter of a Tlingit leader, and named her Minnie. In 1897 he began constructing a frame house just south of his father's cabin. This small beginning became the nucleus of the present Ben Moore House. Over the years, continued additions and remodeling created a sizeable home. By 1907 Ben Moore and his family moved to Tacoma, Washington. The house was rented by jeweler Herman Kirmse and later purchased by his wife Hazel in 1914. Today the house is open to the public and depicts life in a pioneer home around 1904.",

      "description": "Listen for the clinking of bottles, laughter, and chatter from the interior of the Mascot, a Gold Rush-era saloon that supplied alcohol to thirsty stampeders and served as a gathering place where men could play pool, gamble, and listen to music. Originally constructed in 1898, a corner entry led to the “Mascotte” saloon, owned by Charles Rohbak, who sold liquor, cigars, and fresh beer on draft for ten cents. In early 1899, however, a new law came into force as Skagway transitioned from frontier town to family town, requiring Skagway’s saloons to pay a $1,500 license fee in order to remain open. Of the 80 saloons reported open in January 1899, all but a dozen had closed by April, including Rohbak’s “Mascotte.” After its closure, entrepreneur Albert Reinert and a partner purchased the building, paid the license fee, and began remodeling the interior. As a former restaurant owner, Reinert knew how to keep customers with offers of free lunches including clam chowder, spareribs, enchiladas, and more, along with locally brewed pilsner beer for a nickel a schooner. But moral reforms were sweeping Skagway at the start of the 20th century, and by 1916 Skagway had voted itself a “dry” town. Impressively, the renamed “Mascot” was one of only three Gold Rush-era saloons that survived until local prohibition. Eventually Reinert sold the Mascot to Perry Hern, who converted the interior to a pharmacy, and owned the complex for the next thirty years. In 1974 the National Park Foundation acquired the structure from George Rapuzzi and Charles Hermans, and in 1976, building ownership transferred to the National Park Service. The Mascot Saloon was restored to its 1905-1916 appearance and today exhibits within depict town life, and replica beer bottles of the brand distributed by the Mascot during its heyday line the shelves.",

Constructed in increments over the decades, it began as a simple flop house called the “Rosalie Hotel.” Lodging houses like the Rosalie were usually board and batten structures that went up quickly to meet the lodging needs of the stampeders. With thousands of anxious prospectors wildly making their way through Skagway on their way to the Klondike Gold Fields, some could find rest on the many bunks and cots within, and feast on meals served en masse. As the Gold Rush era waned, the hotel was remodeled in 1898 to serve as a hardware store. The new owner transformed the shack-like building into a more permanent, sturdy structure and added the false front facing Broadway. Today the Pantheon Saloon is a kid-friendly Junior Ranger Center, where children complete their own journey of the Klondike Gold Rush.",

A reporter in Skagway at the time wrote that “When a steamer whistled in the bay it was not unusual to see two men carefully inspecting each other’s coat sleeves and collars in search of lingering hairs, for there was a considerable wind in Skagway that summer, and hairs – red, blonde, and brunette – were wafted thither and thence by it and were likely to cling to any coat that happened by, and a great deal of trouble was saved by these pre-steamer inspections.” Prostitutes often worked out of one-story shacks, known as “cribs.” In the alley next door to Verbauwhede’s Cigar Store and Confectionery are two small one-story buildings purchase by Verbauwhede in 1902 from the former red-light district known as “French Alley.” These former “cribs” were relocated after moral reforms swept Skagway at the turn of the century as it transitioned into a more permanent, working-class community, putting an end to the Red Light District. They were used as living space by the Verbauwhede family behind their shop and a second one was rented to lodgers. Today these are part of the National Park Service’s Lease Back Program and are available for rent by private businesses.",
