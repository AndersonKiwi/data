      "description": "Why execution by hanging? At the time, hanging was considered the most humane method of execution. When done properly, the neck is broken and death comes quickly.\n\nMurder, rape, treason, and obstruction of an execution were the only Federal crimes with an automatic death sentence. In Fort Smith, 81 men were hanged for murder and 5 for rape. Crowds in the thousands came to Fort Smith to watch the earlier executions. Then a fence was erected and executions became private two years after Judge Parker arrived. In order to attend an execution, individuals had to get permission from the U.S. Marshal by providing a reason to be there. Those who attended executions included reporters, clergy, medical personnel, and family members of both the victim and the condemned. \n\nThe current gallows are a reproduction based on images and historic records. The original gallows was destroyed by the city of Fort Smith in 1897 because of the negative reputation it gave the city. Today the gallows stand as a stark reminder of the struggle for justice on the western frontier.",

The other had a smaller pail for washing. There was no place for a prisoner to bathe. The stench from the jail could be smelled upstairs in the courtroom.

The horrid conditions led to the jail’s nickname, “Hell on the Border.”  \nJudge Parker tried repeatedly, with no success to secure funding to build a better jail.
