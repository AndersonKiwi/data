Seymour painted it in 1821, and it’s the only known image of the first Fort Smith.  \n\nThe painting shows a soldier seated on a wooden stool.  We see him from the back, facing toward the water.

      "audio_description": "Bass Reeves Statue.  1 ¾ minutes.  First of two messages at this location.  You’re at the north edge of Ross Pendergraft Park—a small urban park featuring grassy patches, crisscrossing paths, park benches, and a few trees and flowers.  A larger-than-life bronze statue on this spot depicts U.S. Deputy Marshal Bass Reeves.  The sculpture rests on a pedestal about four feet high, made of light-brown, rough-hewn stones and topped with several rows of red brick.  The statue itself rises another ten feet or so above the pedestal.  \n\nThe charcoal-colored sculpture depicts Reeves astride his horse.  He sits up straight in the saddle, holding the reins in his left hand and balancing his rifle in his right.  The butt of the rifle rests on his thigh with the barrel pointing up to the sky.  Reeves wears a wide-brimmed hat with a rounded top and looks right, off into the distance.  A dog scampers along on the horse’s right flank, mouth slightly agape. \n\nThe sculpture faces west, toward the Indian Territory.  In fact, a concrete plaque set at a slight angle into the western face of the pedestal identifies the title of the artwork as “Into the Territories.”  The text goes on:  “Sculptor:  Harold T. Holden, Dedicated May 26th, 2012, Guest Reddick Architects.”\n\nA flower bed surrounds the pedestal, with yellow, pink, and purple flowers that blossom in the spring and summer.  Just to the north, a low stone wall about two feet high and 30 feet long separates the statue from the sidewalk that runs along Garrison Avenue.  \n\nEnd of description.\n",

      "audio_description": "Wayside Panel:  Officers’ Quarters – Main Text.  2 ¼ minutes.  First of two descriptions at this location.  This wayside panel is located near the south corner of one of two officers’ quarters constructed and used during the second Fort Smith era, between 1838 and 1871.  Today, all that exists from the building is a cement pad about 75 feet by 20 feet – the same size as the original building foundation. The rectangular pad sits on the western edge of the Parade Ground, parallel to the oval-shaped path that rings the Parade Ground.\n\nBrick lines set into the cement pad mark the original locations of the building’s interior walls.  In addition, a dozen brick squares, about 1 foot by 1 foot each, have been placed in a line parallel to the front edge of the cement pad, about six feet in front of it.   They mark the locations of the building’s original columns.  The squares stick up an inch or two from the grass, so watch your step if you venture off the path.\n\nThe wayside panel includes black-and-white images and text.  The main text reads:\n\n“You are now standing on what was once Officer's Row at the second Fort Smith. From 1846 to 1865, two large buildings stood on the western edge of the parade ground and provided housing for officers and their families. Unlike the cramped quarters of the enlisted men's barracks, there was a degree of privacy here. Large front and back porches, yards, and gardens surrounded by picket fences provided further domestic comforts.\n\n“Fire destroyed both Officers’ Quarters in 1865 and 1870. In 2000, the National Park Service placed the concrete pads here to show the approximate locations and floor plans of both buildings.”  End of text.\n\nThe images and additional text are described in the next message.\n\nWayside Panel: Officers’ Quarters – Images.  Three minutes.  Second of two descriptions at this location.  On the upper right-hand corner of this panel is a faded black-and-white photograph of the officers’ quarters.  The photo shows a two-story building with a pitched roof and six chimneys.  Twelve brick columns support open porches that run across the long façade on both the first and second floors. A white picket fence encircles the building, and a man stands near the gate.  Several small trees shade the front of the building.\n\nBelow the image is the following quote from Mary Rutherford Cravens recalling “Social Life in the Garrison”:\n\n\"The great front porches were common rendezvous for the officers, their families and friends, and we used to delight in being there to watch the soldiers drill, hear the bugles’ shrill call, and listen to the fine concerts by the army band on the parade grounds. The hospitality of the officers and their wives was unstinted, and many delightful functions were enjoyed by friends from the town and surrounding country.\"  End of text.\n\nBelow this is another photograph.  This one depicts Captain Samuel Sturgis, Commander at Fort Smith from 1859 to 1861, along with his family.  The Captain stands on the left, in uniform, his right hand tucked into his shirt.  His wife sits in front, her floor-length skirt billowing.  Their three children stand beside her, nearly expressionless.  The photograph is from the Collection of the New-York Historical Society.  Text beside it reads:\n\n“Officer's wives and children shared the trials and tribulations of military life with their husbands and fathers. At Fort Smith, Sturgis' son, Jack, was badly burned when two other boys accidentally exploded twelve pounds of gunpowder. Jack carried a facial scar until his death as a lieutenant at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876.”  End of text.\n\nTo the left is a drawing of the Fort Smith cistern, which is located about 80 feet to your north.  The drawing shows a small dome of stone and mortar protruding above ground level with a large subterranean storage tank below it.  Gravel covers the bottom of the storage area, with water filling about half of the remaining space.  Text beside the picture reads:\n\n“The Cistern – Following the Civil War, the U.S. Army constructed a dome-shaped cistern between the two officer's quarters. This underground storage tank is 22 feet deep and holds 55,000 gallons of water. The cistern, enlisted men’s barracks, and the commissary are the only structures remaining from the second Fort period, 1838-1871.”\n\nEnd of description.\n",

Two years after Judge Parker arrived, a fence was erected and executions became private. In order to attend an execution, individuals had to get permission from the U.S. Marshal by providing a reason to be there. Those who attended executions included reporters, clergy, medical personnel, and family members of both the victim and the condemned. \n\nThe current gallows are a reproduction based on images and historic records. The original gallows was destroyed by the city of Fort Smith in 1897 because of the negative reputation it gave the city. \n",

Second of two descriptions at this location.  This wayside panel is titled “Defending Freedom.”  It’s about 3 ½ feet wide and 2 feet deep, and stands about 2 ½ feet off the ground on thin metal legs.\n\nThe panel’s single image depicts members of the United States Colored Troops practicing bayonet lunges on the Fort Smith Parade ground in 1864.  In the full-color illustration, seven soldiers in blue uniforms face the viewer with bayonets drawn.  To the right, a drill-master appears to be urging them on.  To the left, two officers look on approvingly.  Behind the soldiers, the flagpole rises up in the center of the painting, with the barracks to the right.  On the left are the officers’ quarters, which no longer exist.\n\nText on the upper right reads:\n\n“Black infantry drilled on the parade ground in front of you. At various times during the Civil War, Fort Smith housed four regiments of U.S. Colored Troops (USCT). One was organized locally. Drills increased after Confederate soldiers mercilessly massacred black troops who had surrendered at Poison Springs in 1864. Many of the troops were former slaves. Later that year, the 11th USCT, on duty in Indian Territory, battled Confederate cavalry in one of many Civil War skirmishes fought by Fort Smith troops. By war’s end about 10 percent of all Union troops were USCT regiments.”  End of text\n\nOn the upper left is a quote from General Blunt.  It’s dated July 17, 1863, after the Battle of Honey Springs.  It reads:\n\n“I never saw such fighting done as was done by the negro regiment… The question that negroes will fight is settled; besides they make better soldiers in every respect than any troops I have ever had under my command.” \n\nEnd of description",

From the main walkway that runs along the river, two side paths jut out toward the water, about 40 feet apart.  The side paths angle in toward each other, creating a three-sided overlook with a broad viewing platform parallel to the river.  A stone wall about 3 feet high runs along the outer edge of the overlook.\n\nSix wayside panels can be found in the area.  An introductory panel is located alongside the main path, in between the two sides of the overlook.  Five other panels are mounted on the stone wall overlooking the river.  Each of these waysides tells the story of one of the Native American tribes that passed through Fort Smith on the Trail of Tears.  All of the panels are audio described in the following messages.  A park bench is located in the middle of the triangle, facing the panels.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the overlook, a small stairway descends through a gap in the wall to the ground below, which slopes toward the river.

You are just outside the perimeter of the second Fort Smith, which was built in 1838.  About 15 feet to the left of this wayside panel, a line of stones in the grass intersects with the cement walkway.  The strip of grey stone, about one foot across, marks the location of the former fort wall.  Where the wall line intersects the walkway, there are two light grey stone pillars that create a kind of entranceway into the site.  The pillars step up from the sides to a height of about 4 feet where they frame the pathway.\n\nThe path continues into the site another 30 feet or so, where it meets an oval-shaped walkway that encircles the open Parade Ground.  A flagpole in the middle of the Parade Ground rises about 100 feet above the grass, and an American flag with 37 stars flies at its top.   Just to the right of the Parade Ground is the former barracks/courthouse/jail building—now the Visitor Center.  Further to your right as you face the flagpole is the gallows—about 60 feet away.  It’s a white structure surrounded by a tall white wood plank fence. \n\nEnd of description.\n\nWayside Panel: Fort Wall – Panel Description.  2 ¼ minutes.  Second of two descriptions at this location. A single, colorful image takes up this entire panel.  It’s a reproduction of a 1911 painting by Treseder that shows how the second Fort Smith might have looked in the 1850s.  The painting depicts the fort from the north—directly opposite the side you’re on now. The view is from a slightly elevated perspective so that the interior of the compound is visible over the stone wall that encircles it.  \n\nThe jail/barracks/courthouse building stands in the middle of the scene, with the flagpole to its right.  Several other buildings occupy the site, including a row of two-story structures along the right-hand wall of the compound. The gentle rolling landscape outside the fort walls is dotted with smaller houses and trees.  The Arkansas River flows past in the background.  Text at the top of the panel reads:\n\n“Security has always been a concern for the U.S. military. The army designed the second Fort Smith (1838-1871) as part of a line of forts from Minnesota to Louisiana to separate the territory occupied by Native American tribes from that settled by American citizens. To provide protection in the event of an attack, military engineers called for the construction of a fort with five bastions (gun emplacements), and a massive stone wall that was 12 feet high and 2 feet thick.\n\n“Fort Smith represents the last of a dying breed; from the 1840s on, virtually all frontier forts were built without walls. After Fort Smith was built, the cost of constructing a wall was considered too great in comparison to the benefit of a fortified defense. The fort walls remained in place throughout the federal court era (1872-1897), affording a level of security for proceedings and the executions that took place. Today the location of the original wall is outlined by a continuous band of stone.”  \n\nEnd of description.",

You’re facing southeast from the site of the former Fort Smith guardhouse.  The view is of a grassy field with some modern city buildings several hundred feet in the distance, including the Fort Smith Museum of History.  About 150 feet to your right is the former jail/barracks/courthouse building, now the National Park Service visitor center.\n\nThe angled wayside panel is approximately 36 inches wide and 24 inches high.  It features three black-and-white images set against a beige background.  They’ll be described in the next message.  The main text on the top center of the panel reads:  \n\n“After the U.S. Army closed Fort Smith in 1871, the guardhouse served the Federal Court for the Western District of Arkansas.  It remained in use as a jail, detaining primarily women suspected or convicted of federal crimes until 1888.  At that time, the court moved quarters for female prisoners into the courthouse/jail building.  Although not as numerous as their male counterparts, female prisoners were no novelty in Fort Smith.  They committed the same crimes as men in the Indian Territory, ranging from the illegal sale of whiskey to murder.  When convicted, they received the same sentences – fines, jail time or death by hanging.  From 1873 to 1874 the guardhouse also briefly functioned as “Death Row” by holding the men condemned to die on the gallows.” \n\nEnd of description.\n\nWayside Panel:  Women’s Jail, 1872-1888 – Images and Additional Text.  Two minutes.  Fifth of five descriptions at this location. On this panel’s upper right is a front view of the guardhouse taken from the original 1849 construction drawings.  It shows a one-story rectangular building with a high pitched roof, a central doorway, two windows, two chimneys, and four columns in front—all symmetrically arranged.  An 1894 fire severely damaged the guardhouse, but it probably remained standing until 1896.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the panel is a black-and-white photo of a bearded man in a dark suit, white shirt, and gray cap.  The text below reads:\n\n“Jail Guard Robert Jackson, circa 1896.  During the time that the old guard house was used as a women’s prison, the U.S. Marshal had to hire additional guards to watch over female prisoners in the guardhouse.  Working as a jail guard was considered very desirable, as guards were paid a fixed salary often much higher than that of a deputy marshal.”  End of text.\n\nFinally, in the bottom center of the panel is a photograph of a woman sitting side-saddle on a dark horse.  She looks grimly at the camera, wearing 19th-century clothing, including a hat, and a large pistol holstered at her hip.  The text below reads:\n\n“Romanticized in the movies as a ‘Bandit Queen’ or ‘Lady Robin Hood,’ Belle Starr was neither.  She had entered into a life of petty crime during the Civil War and continued in that vein until her murder in 1889.  Belle was brought in front of Judge Parker on charges of horse theft in 1883, found guilty and sentenced to a year in the Detroit House of Corrections.  It is likely that while awaiting trial, Belle Starr was imprisoned here.”\n\nEnd of description.",

Although four women were sentenced to hang, none were executed at Fort Smith.\nIf a female prisoner had a child and no family members or friends to take care of the child, he or she went to jail too. We know of at least two children who served time with their mothers. During the day, the children were allowed to play on the grounds. \n\n",

A line of thin trees grows right along the water’s edge.  Across the water, about a quarter mile away, is the state of Oklahoma.  \n\nThe panel is 2 feet deep by 3 ½ feet wide and about 2 ½ feet tall.  A full-color illustration shows a young family of four sitting on a bluff above the river.  The father stands, and holding his daughter’s hand, looks out over the water.  He wears a ragged shirt and hat. The mother kneels in front with a baby in her arms.  Down below, at the river’s edge, a mob waits to board an already crowded steamboat.  Text above the image reads:  \n\n“Standing at this spot during the second half of the Civil War you would have witnessed a very chaotic scene. The riverfront landing at the end of Garrison Avenue would have been filled with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of desperate people anxiously waiting and hoping to find available passage on outgoing steamboats.\n\n“Those waiting were orphans, former slaves, pro-Union sympathizers, and rural families seeking protection at Fort Smith from an indiscriminate war. Rogue soldiers (bushwhackers) scavenged the countryside for vengeance, food, livestock, and valuables. Families, like this one, left everything to save themselves and begin a new life—without war.”  End of text.\n\nA quote on the lower left from the Kansas Newspaper Editor reads:\n\n“The people are becoming desperate, exposed as they are to horse thieves on the one hand, and bushwhackers on the other.” \n\nText on the panel’s lower right asks:  “Do you have ancestors who were displaced or suffered hardship as the result of a civil war?” \n\nEnd of description.\n",

This wayside panel is located beside the cement walkway that runs parallel to the riverbank.  The water’s edge is about 80 feet west of here, down a gentle grassy slope.  The Poteau River flows in from the left, and a small bay bulges out from the river directly across from you.  To the right of the bay, the Arkansas River streams in.  It joins with the Poteau and continues off to your right.  Deciduous forests populate the far banks of the rivers, and a few fallen trees, or snags, poke their branches up from the beneath water in a couple of spots.  \n\nJust behind you, to the left, is a park bench.  Beyond that, a steep hill rises up about 20 feet.   The remnants of the First Fort Smith sits atop its plateau.  \n\nThe brown wayside panel features a block of text along its left side.  On the right are several images that will be described in the next message.  The main text reads:\n\n“Two hundred and fifty years ago the river you see here flowed through the homeland of one of the most powerful Indian nations in the center of the continent.  They called themselves “Wah-Zha-Zhe.”  Early French explorers spelled their name “Ouchage.”  Osage people lived and hunted from the woodlands and rich river bottoms of present-day Missouri and Arkansas to the open plains of Kansas and Oklahoma 250 miles to the west.\n\n“Changes came fast and furious after France sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803.  Thousands of Cherokee had already moved into this region because white settlers were flooding into the Cherokee lands in Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas.  Fighting broke out.  Then the U.S. Army set up a garrison here at Fort Smith to try to keep the peace.\n\n“Osage leaders worried that crowding would lead the U.S. Government to demand that they give up more lands to make room for Indians being removed from the East.  In less than a generation, their tragic forecasts became true.”\n\nEnd of description.\n",

Just to your left are some of the archaeological remains of the fort—a stone foundation built into the crest of the hill.  Further down the hill near the water’s edge is the Trail of Tears Overlook, which features a series of wayside panels describing the historical travails of the local Indian nations.  \n\nThe panel shows an artist’s rendering of the first Fort Smith.  The view looks west from a slightly elevated position.  This allows us to peer inside the stockade, where groups of soldiers drill and fire cannons.  A small band of Native Americans confer with a man in uniform near a row of three white tents.  The Arkansas and Poteau Rivers are visible in the background, but unlike today, the rocky shoreline is clear of trees.  Text above the image reads:\n\n“In the spring of 1821, Osage leader Bad-Tempered-Buffalo appeared across the Arkansas River with 400 warriors in war paint. He and seven warriors crossed the river requesting gunpowder and permission to hunt on Cherokee land. Acting fort commander, Lieutenant Martin Scott, refused both requests.  The Osage left the fort having received the answer they expected.\n\n“In full view, the Osage cut trees, built rafts, and appeared ready to attack. Outnumbered ten to one, Lt. Scott, ordered the fort’s two cannons prepared for battle. After seeing this, the Osage left without incident. According to Osage oral tradition, Bad-Tempered-Buffalo’s actions were a bluff intended to scare the nearby Cherokee, intimidate the temporary commander, and reaffirm the Osage presence.”\n\nEnd of description.\n",

Although guards threw water across the flagstone floor to “cool” the jail it only added to the humidity making the conditions worse.\n\nHygiene was poor.
