It was originally built as a one-story structure with basement during the second Fort Smith period (1838-1871). It served as the enlisted soldiers’ barracks and basement dining room. During the Federal Court period (1872-1896), the barracks became the courtroom, the basement became the “Hell on the Border” jail, and a second story was added. In 1888, the building changed again with the completion of a new three-story jail. Tour the building to experience the first jail and see first- hand why it earned the nickname of being “Hell on the Border”, and compare the improvement of conditions with the construction of the second jail. There are exhibits about tough outlaws, tougher lawmen, and the toughest of them all, Judge Isaac C. Parker. Other exhibits explore Fort Smith’s role in Westward Expansion and Federal Indian Policy.",

The guardhouse was also the place of confinement for soldiers under arrest for such offenses as drunkenness, desertion, or fighting. After the U.S. Army closed Fort Smith in 1871, the federal court converted the guardhouse into a jail for women.   If a female prisoner had a child and no family members or friends to take care of the child, he or she went to jail too. During the day, the children were allowed to play on the grounds. We know of at least to two children who served time with their mothers.  Crimes committed by women ranged from the illegal sale of whiskey to murder. When convicted, they received the same sentences as men – fines, jail time, or death by hanging. Although four women were sentenced to hang, none were executed at Fort Smith.",

In Fort Smith, 81 men were hanged for murder and 5 for rape. Crowds in the thousands came to Fort Smith to watch the earlier executions before the fence was erected. Executions became private two years after Judge Parker arrived. In order to attend an execution one had to get permission from the U.S. Marshal by providing a reason to be there. Those who attended executions included reporters, clergy, medical personnel, family members of both the victim and the condemned.  The current gallows are a reproduction based on images and historic records. The original gallows was destroyed by the city of Fort Smith in 1897 because of the negative reputation it gave the city. Today the gallows stand as a stark reminder of the struggle for justice on the western frontier.",
