The rectangular pad sits on the western edge of the Parade Ground, parallel to the oval-shaped path that rings the Parade Ground.\n\nBrick lines set into the cement pad mark the original locations of the building’s interior walls.  In addition, a dozen brick squares, about 1 foot by 1 foot each, have been placed in a line parallel to the front edge of the cement pad, about six feet in front of it.   They mark the locations of the building’s original columns.  The squares stick up an inch or two from the grass, so watch your step if you venture off the path.\n\nThe wayside panel includes black-and-white images and text.  The main text reads:\n\n“You are now standing on what was once Officer's Row at the second Fort Smith. From 1846 to 1865, two large buildings stood on the western edge of the parade ground and provided housing for officers and their families. Unlike the cramped quarters of the enlisted men's barracks, there was a degree of privacy here. Large front and back porches, yards, and gardens surrounded by picket fences provided further domestic comforts.\n\n“Fire destroyed both Officers’ Quarters in 1865 and 1870.

A white picket fence encircles the building, and a man stands near the gate.  Several small trees shade the front of the building.\n\nBelow the image is the following quote from Mary Rutherford Cravens recalling “Social Life in the Garrison”:\n\n\"The great front porches were common rendezvous for the officers, their families and friends, and we used to delight in being there to watch the soldiers drill, hear the bugles’ shrill call, and listen to the fine concerts by the army band on the parade grounds. The hospitality of the officers and their wives was unstinted, and many delightful functions were enjoyed by friends from the town and surrounding country.\"  End of text.\n\nBelow this is another photograph.  This one depicts Captain Samuel Sturgis, Commander at Fort Smith from 1859 to 1861, along with his family.  The Captain stands on the left, in uniform, his right hand tucked into his shirt.  His wife sits in front, her floor-length skirt billowing.  Their three children stand beside her, nearly expressionless.  The photograph is from the Collection of the New-York Historical Society.  Text beside it reads:\n\n“Officer's wives and children shared the trials and tribulations of military life with their husbands and fathers. At Fort Smith, Sturgis' son, Jack, was badly burned when two other boys accidentally exploded twelve pounds of gunpowder. Jack carried a facial scar until his death as a lieutenant at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876.”  End of text.\n\nTo the left is a drawing of the Fort Smith cistern, which is located about 80 feet to your north.

The pillars step up from the sides to a height of about 4 feet where they frame the pathway.\n\nThe path continues into the site another 30 feet or so, where it meets an oval-shaped walkway that encircles the open Parade Ground.  A flagpole in the middle of the Parade Ground rises about 100 feet above the grass, and an American flag with 37 stars flies at its top.   Just to the right of the Parade Ground is the former barracks/courthouse/jail building—now the Visitor Center.  Further to your right as you face the flagpole is the gallows—about 60 feet away.  It’s a white structure surrounded by a tall white wood plank fence. \n\nEnd of description.\n\nWayside Panel: Fort Wall – Panel Description.  2 ¼ minutes.  Second of two descriptions at this location. A single, colorful image takes up this entire panel.  It’s a reproduction of a 1911 painting by Treseder that shows how the second Fort Smith might have looked in the 1850s.  The painting depicts the fort from the north—directly opposite the side you’re on now. The view is from a slightly elevated perspective so that the interior of the compound is visible over the stone wall that encircles it.  \n\nThe jail/barracks/courthouse building stands in the middle of the scene, with the flagpole to its right.  Several other buildings occupy the site, including a row of two-story structures along the right-hand wall of the compound. The gentle rolling landscape outside the fort walls is dotted with smaller houses and trees.  The Arkansas River flows past in the background.  Text at the top of the panel reads:\n\n“Security has always been a concern for the U.S. military. The army designed the second Fort Smith (1838-1871) as part of a line of forts from Minnesota to Louisiana to separate the territory occupied by Native American tribes from that settled by American citizens. To provide protection in the event of an attack, military engineers called for the construction of a fort with five bastions (gun emplacements), and a massive stone wall that was 12 feet high and 2 feet thick.\n\n“Fort Smith represents the last of a dying breed; from the 1840s on, virtually all frontier forts were built without walls. After Fort Smith was built, the cost of constructing a wall was considered too great in comparison to the benefit of a fortified defense. The fort walls remained in place throughout the federal court era (1872-1897), affording a level of security for proceedings and the executions that took place. Today the location of the original wall is outlined by a continuous band of stone.”  \n\nEnd of description.","description":"The plan for Fort Smith was based on coastal fort design with a stone wall 12 feet high and 2 feet thick.

The gallows area is about 50 feet by 50 feet and enclosed by a white wood plank fence 12 feet high.  Within the area, along the south edge of the enclosure, is the gallows structure itself.  \n\nThe gallows structure features a wooden platform about 30 feet long by 20 feet deep.  The platform sits about 6 feet off the ground, supported by 4 one-foot square columns.  Stairs lead up to the platform on the right side, but these are closed to the public.  A horizontal beam sits about 10 feet above the platform, running the full length of gallows.  This is the cross beam, from which the noose would have been hung.  It rests on two square support columns and is braced from above by two diagonal beams.  The whole structure is painted white.  It’s topped by shingled wooden roof that slopes down toward the back, where it meets a 13-foot stone support wall.   \n\nA single door in the fence opposite the gallows structure provides access to the area.  To your right as you enter, is a white metal box on a stand.  The box is about a foot on each side and three feet off the ground.

At the time, hanging was considered the most humane method of execution. When done properly, the neck is broken and death comes quickly.\n\nMurder, rape, treason, and obstruction of an execution were the only Federal crimes with an automatic death sentence. In Fort Smith, 81 men were hanged for murder and 5 for rape. Crowds in the thousands came to watch the earlier executions. Two years after Judge Parker arrived, a fence was erected and executions became private. In order to attend an execution, individuals had to get permission from the U.S. Marshal by providing a reason to be there. Those who attended executions included reporters, clergy, medical personnel, and family members of both the victim and the condemned. \n\nThe current gallows are a reproduction based on images and historic records. The original gallows was destroyed by the city of Fort Smith in 1897 because of the negative reputation it gave the city. \n","geofence_buffer_in_meters":15.791199814681606,"id":95,"information":[{"description":"August 15, 1873\nJohn Childers\n\nOctober 10, 1873\nTunagee, alias Tuni\nYoung Wolf\n\nApril 3, 1874\nJohn Billy\nIsaac Filmore\nJohn Pointer\n\nJanuary 15, 1875\nMcClish Impson\n\nSeptember 3, 1875\nFirst execution under the tenure of Judge Isaac Parker\nEdmund Campbell\nDaniel Evans\nSamuel Fooy\nSmoker Mankiller\nJames Moore\nWilliam Whittington\n\nApril 21, 1876\nGibson Ishtanubbee\nWilliam Leach\nOrpheus McGee\nIsham Seeley\nAaron Wilson\n\nSeptember 8, 1876\nSamuel Peters\nOsey Sanders\nJohn Valley\nSinker Wilson\n\nDecember 20, 1878\nJames Diggs\nJohn Postoak\n\nAugust 29, 1879\nWilliam Elliot Wiley, alias Colorado Bill\nDr. Henri Stewart\n\nSeptember 9, 1881 \nWilliam Brown\nAbler Manley\nAmos Manley\nPatrick McGowen\nGeorge W.

The main text on the top center of the panel reads:  \n\n“After the U.S. Army closed Fort Smith in 1871, the guardhouse served the Federal Court for the Western District of Arkansas.  It remained in use as a jail, detaining primarily women suspected or convicted of federal crimes until 1888.  At that time, the court moved quarters for female prisoners into the courthouse/jail building.  Although not as numerous as their male counterparts, female prisoners were no novelty in Fort Smith.  They committed the same crimes as men in the Indian Territory, ranging from the illegal sale of whiskey to murder.  When convicted, they received the same sentences – fines, jail time or death by hanging.  From 1873 to 1874 the guardhouse also briefly functioned as “Death Row” by holding the men condemned to die on the gallows.” \n\nEnd of description.\n\nWayside Panel:  Women’s Jail, 1872-1888 – Images and Additional Text.  Two minutes.  Fifth of five descriptions at this location. On this panel’s upper right is a front view of the guardhouse taken from the original 1849 construction drawings.  It shows a one-story rectangular building with a high pitched roof, a central doorway, two windows, two chimneys, and four columns in front—all symmetrically arranged.  An 1894 fire severely damaged the guardhouse, but it probably remained standing until 1896.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the panel is a black-and-white photo of a bearded man in a dark suit, white shirt, and gray cap.  The text below reads:\n\n“Jail Guard Robert Jackson, circa 1896.  During the time that the old guard house was used as a women’s prison, the U.S. Marshal had to hire additional guards to watch over female prisoners in the guardhouse.  Working as a jail guard was considered very desirable, as guards were paid a fixed salary often much higher than that of a deputy marshal.”  End of text.\n\nFinally, in the bottom center of the panel is a photograph of a woman sitting side-saddle on a dark horse.  She looks grimly at the camera, wearing 19th-century clothing, including a hat, and a large pistol holstered at her hip.  The text below reads:\n\n“Romanticized in the movies as a ‘Bandit Queen’ or ‘Lady Robin Hood,’ Belle Starr was neither.  She had entered into a life of petty crime during the Civil War and continued in that vein until her murder in 1889.  Belle was brought in front of Judge Parker on charges of horse theft in 1883, found guilty and sentenced to a year in the Detroit House of Corrections.  It is likely that while awaiting trial, Belle Starr was imprisoned here.”\n\nEnd of description.","description":"After the U.S. Army closed Fort Smith in 1871, the federal court converted the guardhouse into a jail for women.
